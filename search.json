    "text": "Welcome to the second edition of “R for Data Science”! This is a major reworking of the first edition, removing material we no longer think is useful, adding material we wish we included in the first edition, and generally updating the text and code to reflect changes in best practices. We’re also very excited to welcome a new co-author: Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, a noted data science educator and one of our colleagues at Posit (the company formerly known as RStudio).\nA brief summary of the biggest changes follows:\n\nThe first part of the book has been renamed to “Whole game”. The goal of this section is to give you the rough details of the “whole game” of data science before we dive into the details.\nThe second part of the book is “Visualize”. This part gives data visualization tools and best practices a more thorough coverage compared to the first edition. The best place to get all the details is still the ggplot2 book, but now R4DS covers more of the most important techniques.\nThe third part of the book is now called “Transform” and gains new chapters on numbers, logical vectors, and missing values. These were previously parts of the data transformation chapter, but needed much more room to cover all the details.\nThe fourth part of the book is called “Import”. It’s a new set of chapters that goes beyond reading flat text files to working with spreadsheets, getting data out of databases, working with big data, rectangling hierarchical data, and scraping data from web sites.\nThe “Program” part remains, but has been rewritten from top-to-bottom to focus on the most important parts of function writing and iteration. Function writing now includes details on how to wrap tidyverse functions (dealing with the challenges of tidy evaluation), since this has become much easier and more important over the last few years. We’ve added a new chapter on important base R functions that you’re likely to see in wild-caught R code.\nThe modeling part has been removed. We never had enough room to fully do modelling justice, and there are now much better resources available. We generally recommend using the tidymodels packages and reading Tidy Modeling with R by Max Kuhn and Julia Silge.\nThe “Communicate” part remains, but has been thoroughly updated to feature Quarto instead of R Markdown. This edition of the book has been written in Quarto, and it’s clearly the tool of the future.",

    "text": "What you will learn\nData science is a vast field, and there’s no way you can master it all by reading a single book. This book aims to give you a solid foundation in the most important tools and enough knowledge to find the resources to learn more when necessary. Our model of the steps of a typical data science project looks something like Figure 1.\nFigure 1: In our model of the data science process, you start with data import and tidying. Next, you understand your data with an iterative cycle of transforming, visualizing, and modeling. You finish the process by communicating your results to other humans.\nFirst, you must import your data into R. This typically means that you take data stored in a file, database, or web application programming interface (API) and load it into a data frame in R. If you can’t get your data into R, you can’t do data science on it!\nOnce you’ve imported your data, it is a good idea to tidy it. Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with how it is stored. In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable and each row is an observation. Tidy data is important because the consistent structure lets you focus your efforts on answering questions about the data, not fighting to get the data into the right form for different functions.\nOnce you have tidy data, a common next step is to transform it. Transformation includes narrowing in on observations of interest (like all people in one city or all data from the last year), creating new variables that are functions of existing variables (like computing speed from distance and time), and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means). Together, tidying and transforming are called wrangling because getting your data in a form that’s natural to work with often feels like a fight!\nOnce you have tidy data with the variables you need, there are two main engines of knowledge generation: visualization and modeling. These have complementary strengths and weaknesses, so any real data analysis will iterate between them many times.\nVisualization is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualization will show you things you did not expect or raise new questions about the data. A good visualization might also hint that you’re asking the wrong question or that you need to collect different data. Visualizations can surprise you, but they don’t scale particularly well because they require a human to interpret them.\nModels are complementary tools to visualization. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. Models are fundamentally mathematical or computational tools, so they generally scale well. Even when they don’t, it’s usually cheaper to buy more computers than it is to buy more brains! But every model makes assumptions, and by its very nature, a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means a model cannot fundamentally surprise you.\nThe last step of data science is communication, an absolutely critical part of any data analysis project. It doesn’t matter how well your models and visualization have led you to understand the data unless you can also communicate your results to others.\nSurrounding all these tools is programming. Programming is a cross-cutting tool that you use in nearly every part of a data science project. You don’t need to be an expert programmer to be a successful data scientist, but learning more about programming pays off because becoming a better programmer allows you to automate common tasks and solve new problems with greater ease.\nYou’ll use these tools in every data science project, but they’re not enough for most projects. There’s a rough 80/20 rule at play: you can tackle about 80% of every project using the tools you’ll learn in this book, but you’ll need other tools to tackle the remaining 20%. Throughout this book, we’ll point you to resources where you can learn more.",

    "section": "How this book is organized",
    "text": "How this book is organized\nThe previous description of the tools of data science is organized roughly according to the order in which you use them in an analysis (although, of course, you’ll iterate through them multiple times). In our experience, however, learning data importing and tidying first is suboptimal because, 80% of the time, it’s routine and boring, and the other 20% of the time, it’s weird and frustrating. That’s a bad place to start learning a new subject! Instead, we’ll start with visualization and transformation of data that’s already been imported and tidied. That way, when you ingest and tidy your own data, your motivation will stay high because you know the pain is worth the effort.\nWithin each chapter, we try to adhere to a consistent pattern: start with some motivating examples so you can see the bigger picture, and then dive into the details. Each section of the book is paired with exercises to help you practice what you’ve learned. Although it can be tempting to skip the exercises, there’s no better way to learn than by practicing on real problems.",

    "section": "What you won’t learn",
    "text": "What you won’t learn\nThere are several important topics that this book doesn’t cover. We believe it’s important to stay ruthlessly focused on the essentials so you can get up and running as quickly as possible. That means this book can’t cover every important topic.\nModeling\nModeling is super important for data science, but it’s a big topic, and unfortunately, we just don’t have the space to give it the coverage it deserves here. To learn more about modeling, we highly recommend Tidy Modeling with R by our colleagues Max Kuhn and Julia Silge. This book will teach you the tidymodels family of packages, which, as you might guess from the name, share many conventions with the tidyverse packages we use in this book.\nBig data\nThis book proudly and primarily focuses on small, in-memory datasets. This is the right place to start because you can’t tackle big data unless you have experience with small data. The tools you’ll learn throughout the majority of this book will easily handle hundreds of megabytes of data, and with a bit of care, you can typically use them to work with a few gigabytes of data. We’ll also show you how to get data out of databases and parquet files, both of which are often used to store big data. You won’t necessarily be able to work with the entire dataset, but that’s not a problem because you only need a subset or subsample to answer the question that you’re interested in.\nIf you’re routinely working with larger data (10–100 GB, say), we recommend learning more about data.table. We don’t teach it here because it uses a different interface than the tidyverse and requires you to learn some different conventions. However, it is incredibly faster, and the performance payoff is worth investing some time in learning it if you’re working with large data.\nPython, Julia, and friends\nIn this book, you won’t learn anything about Python, Julia, or any other programming language useful for data science. This isn’t because we think these tools are bad. They’re not! And in practice, most data science teams use a mix of languages, often at least R and Python. But we strongly believe that it’s best to master one tool at a time, and R is a great place to start.",

    "section": "Prerequisites",
    "text": "Prerequisites\nWe’ve made a few assumptions about what you already know to get the most out of this book. You should be generally numerically literate, and it’s helpful if you have some basic programming experience already. If you’ve never programmed before, you might find Hands on Programming with R by Garrett to be a valuable adjunct to this book.\nYou need four things to run the code in this book: R, RStudio, a collection of R packages called the tidyverse, and a handful of other packages. Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible R code. They include reusable functions, documentation that describes how to use them, and sample data.\nR\nTo download R, go to CRAN, the comprehensive R archive network, https://cloud.r-project.org. A new major version of R comes out once a year, and there are 2-3 minor releases each year. It’s a good idea to update regularly. Upgrading can be a bit of a hassle, especially for major versions that require you to re-install all your packages, but putting it off only makes it worse. We recommend R 4.2.0 or later for this book.\nRStudio\nRStudio is an integrated development environment, or IDE, for R programming, which you can download from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. RStudio is updated a couple of times a year, and it will automatically let you know when a new version is out, so there’s no need to check back. It’s a good idea to upgrade regularly to take advantage of the latest and greatest features. For this book, make sure you have at least RStudio 2022.02.0.\nWhen you start RStudio, Figure 2, you’ll see two key regions in the interface: the console pane and the output pane. For now, all you need to know is that you type the R code in the console pane and press enter to run it. You’ll learn more as we go along!1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The RStudio IDE has two key regions: type R code in the console pane on the left, and look for plots in the output pane on the right.\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse\nYou’ll also need to install some R packages. An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of base R. Using packages is key to the successful use of R. The majority of the packages that you will learn in this book are part of the so-called tidyverse. All packages in the tidyverse share a common philosophy of data and R programming and are designed to work together.\nYou can install the complete tidyverse with a single line of code:\n\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nOn your computer, type that line of code in the console, and then press enter to run it. R will download the packages from CRAN and install them on your computer.\nYou will not be able to use the functions, objects, or help files in a package until you load it with library(). Once you have installed a package, you can load it using the library() function:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n#&gt; ── Attaching core tidyverse packages ───────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n#&gt; ✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n#&gt; ✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n#&gt; ✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n#&gt; ✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n#&gt; ✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n#&gt; ── Conflicts ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n#&gt; ✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n#&gt; ✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n#&gt; ℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nThis tells you that tidyverse loads nine packages: dplyr, forcats, ggplot2, lubridate, purrr, readr, stringr, tibble, tidyr. These are considered the core of the tidyverse because you’ll use them in almost every analysis.\nPackages in the tidyverse change fairly frequently. You can see if updates are available by running tidyverse_update().\nOther packages\nThere are many other excellent packages that are not part of the tidyverse because they solve problems in a different domain or are designed with a different set of underlying principles. This doesn’t make them better or worse; it just makes them different. In other words, the complement to the tidyverse is not the messyverse but many other universes of interrelated packages. As you tackle more data science projects with R, you’ll learn new packages and new ways of thinking about data.\nWe’ll use many packages from outside the tidyverse in this book. For example, we’ll use the following packages because they provide interesting datasets for us to work with in the process of learning R:\n\ninstall.packages(\n  c(\"arrow\", \"babynames\", \"curl\", \"duckdb\", \"gapminder\", \n    \"ggrepel\", \"ggridges\", \"ggthemes\", \"hexbin\", \"janitor\", \"Lahman\", \n    \"leaflet\", \"maps\", \"nycflights13\", \"openxlsx\", \"palmerpenguins\", \n    \"repurrrsive\", \"tidymodels\", \"writexl\")\n  )\n\nWe’ll also use a selection of other packages for one off examples. You don’t need to install them now, just remember that whenever you see an error like this:\n\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n#&gt; Error in library(ggrepel) : there is no package called ‘ggrepel’\n\nYou need to run install.packages(\"ggrepel\") to install the package.",

In your console, you type after the &gt;, called the prompt; we don’t show the prompt in the book. In the book, the output is commented out with #&gt;; in your console, it appears directly after your code. These two differences mean that if you’re working with an electronic version of the book, you can easily copy code out of the book and paste it into the console.\nThroughout the book, we use a consistent set of conventions to refer to code:\n\nFunctions are displayed in a code font and followed by parentheses, like sum() or mean().\nOther R objects (such as data or function arguments) are in a code font, without parentheses, like flights or x.\nSometimes, to make it clear which package an object comes from, we’ll use the package name followed by two colons, like dplyr::mutate() or nycflights13::flights. This is also valid R code.",

    "text": "1.2 First steps\nDo penguins with longer flippers weigh more or less than penguins with shorter flippers? You probably already have an answer, but try to make your answer precise. What does the relationship between flipper length and body mass look like? Is it positive? Negative? Linear? Nonlinear? Does the relationship vary by the species of the penguin? How about by the island where the penguin lives? Let’s create visualizations that we can use to answer these questions.\n\n1.2.1 The penguins data frame\nYou can test your answers to those questions with the penguins data frame found in palmerpenguins (a.k.a. palmerpenguins::penguins). A data frame is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and observations (in the rows). penguins contains r nrow(penguins) observations collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER2.\nTo make the discussion easier, let’s define some terms:\n\nA variable is a quantity, quality, or property that you can measure.\nA value is the state of a variable when you measure it. The value of a variable may change from measurement to measurement.\nAn observation is a set of measurements made under similar conditions (you usually make all of the measurements in an observation at the same time and on the same object). An observation will contain several values, each associated with a different variable. We’ll sometimes refer to an observation as a data point.\nTabular data is a set of values, each associated with a variable and an observation. Tabular data is tidy if each value is placed in its own “cell”, each variable in its own column, and each observation in its own row.\n\nIn this context, a variable refers to an attribute of all the penguins, and an observation refers to all the attributes of a single penguin.\nType the name of the data frame in the console and R will print a preview of its contents. Note that it says tibble on top of this preview. In the tidyverse, we use special data frames called tibbles that you will learn more about soon.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis data frame contains r ncol(penguins) columns. For an alternative view, where you can see all variables and the first few observations of each variable, use glimpse(). Or, if you’re in RStudio, run View(penguins) to open an interactive data viewer.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAmong the variables in penguins are:\n\nspecies: a penguin’s species (Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo).\nflipper_length_mm: length of a penguin’s flipper, in millimeters.\nbody_mass_g: body mass of a penguin, in grams.\n\nTo learn more about penguins, open its help page by running ?penguins.\n\n\n1.2.2 Ultimate goal\nOur ultimate goal in this chapter is to recreate the following visualization displaying the relationship between flipper lengths and body masses of these penguins, taking into consideration the species of the penguin.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n1.2.3 Creating a ggplot\nLet’s recreate this plot step-by-step.\nWith ggplot2, you begin a plot with the function ggplot(), defining a plot object that you then add layers to. The first argument of ggplot() is the dataset to use in the graph and so ggplot(data = penguins) creates an empty graph that is primed to display the penguins data, but since we haven’t told it how to visualize it yet, for now it’s empty. This is not a very exciting plot, but you can think of it like an empty canvas you’ll paint the remaining layers of your plot onto.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNext, we need to tell ggplot() how the information from our data will be visually represented. The mapping argument of the ggplot() function defines how variables in your dataset are mapped to visual properties (aesthetics) of your plot. The mapping argument is always defined in the aes() function, and the x and y arguments of aes() specify which variables to map to the x and y axes. For now, we will only map flipper length to the x aesthetic and body mass to the y aesthetic. ggplot2 looks for the mapped variables in the data argument, in this case, penguins.\nThe following plot shows the result of adding these mappings.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOur empty canvas now has more structure – it’s clear where flipper lengths will be displayed (on the x-axis) and where body masses will be displayed (on the y-axis). But the penguins themselves are not yet on the plot. This is because we have not yet articulated, in our code, how to represent the observations from our data frame on our plot.\nTo do so, we need to define a geom: the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data. These geometric objects are made available in ggplot2 with functions that start with geom_. People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms (geom_bar()), line charts use line geoms (geom_line()), boxplots use boxplot geoms (geom_boxplot()), scatterplots use point geoms (geom_point()), and so on.\nThe function geom_point() adds a layer of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot. ggplot2 comes with many geom functions that each adds a different type of layer to a plot. You’ll learn a whole bunch of geoms throughout the book, particularly in Chapter 9.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow we have something that looks like what we might think of as a “scatterplot”. It doesn’t yet match our “ultimate goal” plot, but using this plot we can start answering the question that motivated our exploration: “What does the relationship between flipper length and body mass look like?” The relationship appears to be positive (as flipper length increases, so does body mass), fairly linear (the points are clustered around a line instead of a curve), and moderately strong (there isn’t too much scatter around such a line). Penguins with longer flippers are generally larger in terms of their body mass.\nBefore we add more layers to this plot, let’s pause for a moment and review the warning message we got:\n\nRemoved 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point()).\n\nWe’re seeing this message because there are two penguins in our dataset with missing body mass and/or flipper length values and ggplot2 has no way of representing them on the plot without both of these values. Like R, ggplot2 subscribes to the philosophy that missing values should never silently go missing. This type of warning is probably one of the most common types of warnings you will see when working with real data – missing values are a very common issue and you’ll learn more about them throughout the book, particularly in Chapter 18. For the remaining plots in this chapter we will suppress this warning so it’s not printed alongside every single plot we make.\n\n\n1.2.4 Adding aesthetics and layers\nScatterplots are useful for displaying the relationship between two numerical variables, but it’s always a good idea to be skeptical of any apparent relationship between two variables and ask if there may be other variables that explain or change the nature of this apparent relationship. For example, does the relationship between flipper length and body mass differ by species? Let’s incorporate species into our plot and see if this reveals any additional insights into the apparent relationship between these variables. We will do this by representing species with different colored points.\nTo achieve this, will we need to modify the aesthetic or the geom? If you guessed “in the aesthetic mapping, inside of aes()”, you’re already getting the hang of creating data visualizations with ggplot2! And if not, don’t worry. Throughout the book you will make many more ggplots and have many more opportunities to check your intuition as you make them.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen a categorical variable is mapped to an aesthetic, ggplot2 will automatically assign a unique value of the aesthetic (here a unique color) to each unique level of the variable (each of the three species), a process known as scaling. ggplot2 will also add a legend that explains which values correspond to which levels.\nNow let’s add one more layer: a smooth curve displaying the relationship between body mass and flipper length. Before you proceed, refer back to the code above, and think about how we can add this to our existing plot.\nSince this is a new geometric object representing our data, we will add a new geom as a layer on top of our point geom: geom_smooth(). And we will specify that we want to draw the line of best fit based on a linear model with method = \"lm\".\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe have successfully added lines, but this plot doesn’t look like the plot from Section 1.2.2, which only has one line for the entire dataset as opposed to separate lines for each of the penguin species.\nWhen aesthetic mappings are defined in ggplot(), at the global level, they’re passed down to each of the subsequent geom layers of the plot. However, each geom function in ggplot2 can also take a mapping argument, which allows for aesthetic mappings at the local level that are added to those inherited from the global level. Since we want points to be colored based on species but don’t want the lines to be separated out for them, we should specify color = species for geom_point() only.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nVoila! We have something that looks very much like our ultimate goal, though it’s not yet perfect. We still need to use different shapes for each species of penguins and improve labels.\nIt’s generally not a good idea to represent information using only colors on a plot, as people perceive colors differently due to color blindness or other color vision differences. Therefore, in addition to color, we can also map species to the shape aesthetic.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that the legend is automatically updated to reflect the different shapes of the points as well.\nAnd finally, we can improve the labels of our plot using the labs() function in a new layer. Some of the arguments to labs() might be self explanatory: title adds a title and subtitle adds a subtitle to the plot. Other arguments match the aesthetic mappings, x is the x-axis label, y is the y-axis label, and color and shape define the label for the legend. In addition, we can improve the color palette to be colorblind safe with the scale_color_colorblind() function from the ggthemes package.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe finally have a plot that perfectly matches our “ultimate goal”!\n\n\n1.2.5 Exercises\n\nHow many rows are in penguins? How many columns?\nWhat does the bill_depth_mm variable in the penguins data frame describe? Read the help for ?penguins to find out.\nMake a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm. That is, make a scatterplot with bill_depth_mm on the y-axis and bill_length_mm on the x-axis.

    "text": "1.4 Visualizing distributions\nHow you visualize the distribution of a variable depends on the type of variable: categorical or numerical.\n\n1.4.1 A categorical variable\nA variable is categorical if it can only take one of a small set of values. To examine the distribution of a categorical variable, you can use a bar chart. The height of the bars displays how many observations occurred with each x value.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn bar plots of categorical variables with non-ordered levels, like the penguin species above, it’s often preferable to reorder the bars based on their frequencies. Doing so requires transforming the variable to a factor (how R handles categorical data) and then reordering the levels of that factor.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou will learn more about factors and functions for dealing with factors (like fct_infreq() shown above) in Chapter 16.\n\n\n1.4.2 A numerical variable\nA variable is numerical (or quantitative) if it can take on a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add, subtract, or take averages with those values. Numerical variables can be continuous or discrete.\nOne commonly used visualization for distributions of continuous variables is a histogram.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nA histogram divides the x-axis into equally spaced bins and then uses the height of a bar to display the number of observations that fall in each bin. In the graph above, the tallest bar shows that 39 observations have a body_mass_g value between 3,500 and 3,700 grams, which are the left and right edges of the bar.\nYou can set the width of the intervals in a histogram with the binwidth argument, which is measured in the units of the x variable. You should always explore a variety of binwidths when working with histograms, as different binwidths can reveal different patterns. In the plots below a binwidth of 20 is too narrow, resulting in too many bars, making it difficult to determine the shape of the distribution. Similarly, a binwidth of 2,000 is too high, resulting in all data being binned into only three bars, and also making it difficult to determine the shape of the distribution. A binwidth of 200 provides a sensible balance.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAn alternative visualization for distributions of numerical variables is a density plot. A density plot is a smoothed-out version of a histogram and a practical alternative, particularly for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution. We won’t go into how geom_density() estimates the density (you can read more about that in the function documentation), but let’s explain how the density curve is drawn with an analogy. Imagine a histogram made out of wooden blocks. Then, imagine that you drop a cooked spaghetti string over it. The shape the spaghetti will take draped over blocks can be thought of as the shape of the density curve. It shows fewer details than a histogram but can make it easier to quickly glean the shape of the distribution, particularly with respect to modes and skewness.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n1.4.3 Exercises\n\nMake a bar plot of species of penguins, where you assign species to the y aesthetic. How is this plot different?\nHow are the following two plots different? Which aesthetic, color or fill, is more useful for changing the color of bars?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhat does the bins argument in geom_histogram() do?\nMake a histogram of the carat variable in the diamonds dataset that is available when you load the tidyverse package.

    "section": "1.5 Visualizing relationships",
    "text": "1.5 Visualizing relationships\nTo visualize a relationship we need to have at least two variables mapped to aesthetics of a plot. In the following sections you will learn about commonly used plots for visualizing relationships between two or more variables and the geoms used for creating them.\n\n1.5.1 A numerical and a categorical variable\nTo visualize the relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable we can use side-by-side box plots. A boxplot is a type of visual shorthand for measures of position (percentiles) that describe a distribution. It is also useful for identifying potential outliers. As shown in Figure 1.1, each boxplot consists of:\n\nA box that indicates the range of the middle half of the data, a distance known as the interquartile range (IQR), stretching from the 25th percentile of the distribution to the 75th percentile. In the middle of the box is a line that displays the median, i.e. 50th percentile, of the distribution. These three lines give you a sense of the spread of the distribution and whether or not the distribution is symmetric about the median or skewed to one side.\nVisual points that display observations that fall more than 1.5 times the IQR from either edge of the box. These outlying points are unusual so are plotted individually.\nA line (or whisker) that extends from each end of the box and goes to the farthest non-outlier point in the distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Diagram depicting how a boxplot is created.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the distribution of body mass by species using geom_boxplot():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAlternatively, we can make density plots with geom_density().\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe’ve also customized the thickness of the lines using the linewidth argument in order to make them stand out a bit more against the background.\nAdditionally, we can map species to both color and fill aesthetics and use the alpha aesthetic to add transparency to the filled density curves. This aesthetic takes values between 0 (completely transparent) and 1 (completely opaque). In the following plot it’s set to 0.5.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote the terminology we have used here:\n\nWe map variables to aesthetics if we want the visual attribute represented by that aesthetic to vary based on the values of that variable.\nOtherwise, we set the value of an aesthetic.\n\n\n\n1.5.2 Two categorical variables\nWe can use stacked bar plots to visualize the relationship between two categorical variables. For example, the following two stacked bar plots both display the relationship between island and species, or specifically, visualizing the distribution of species within each island.\nThe first plot shows the frequencies of each species of penguins on each island. The plot of frequencies shows that there are equal numbers of Adelies on each island. But we don’t have a good sense of the percentage balance within each island.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe second plot, a relative frequency plot created by setting position = \"fill\" in the geom, is more useful for comparing species distributions across islands since it’s not affected by the unequal numbers of penguins across the islands. Using this plot we can see that Gentoo penguins all live on Biscoe island and make up roughly 75% of the penguins on that island, Chinstrap all live on Dream island and make up roughly 50% of the penguins on that island, and Adelie live on all three islands and make up all of the penguins on Torgersen.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn creating these bar charts, we map the variable that will be separated into bars to the x aesthetic, and the variable that will change the colors inside the bars to the fill aesthetic.\n\n\n1.5.3 Two numerical variables\nSo far you’ve learned about scatterplots (created with geom_point()) and smooth curves (created with geom_smooth()) for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables. A scatterplot is probably the most commonly used plot for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n1.5.4 Three or more variables\nAs we saw in Section 1.2.4, we can incorporate more variables into a plot by mapping them to additional aesthetics. For example, in the following scatterplot the colors of points represent species and the shapes of points represent islands.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHowever adding too many aesthetic mappings to a plot makes it cluttered and difficult to make sense of. Another way, which is particularly useful for categorical variables, is to split your plot into facets, subplots that each display one subset of the data.\nTo facet your plot by a single variable, use facet_wrap(). The first argument of facet_wrap() is a formula3, which you create with ~ followed by a variable name. The variable that you pass to facet_wrap() should be categorical.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou will learn about many other geoms for visualizing distributions of variables and relationships between them in Chapter 9.\n\n\n1.5.5 Exercises\n\nThe mpg data frame that is bundled with the ggplot2 package contains r nrow(mpg) observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on r mpg |&gt; distinct(model) |&gt; nrow() car models. Which variables in mpg are categorical? Which variables are numerical? (Hint: Type ?mpg to read the documentation for the dataset.) How can you see this information when you run mpg?\nMake a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ using the mpg data frame. Next, map a third, numerical variable to color, then size, then both color and size, then shape. How do these aesthetics behave differently for categorical vs. numerical variables?\nIn the scatterplot of hwy vs. displ, what happens if you map a third variable to linewidth?\nWhat happens if you map the same variable to multiple aesthetics?\nMake a scatterplot of bill_depth_mm vs. bill_length_mm and color the points by species. What does adding coloring by species reveal about the relationship between these two variables? What about faceting by species?\nWhy does the following yield two separate legends? How would you fix it to combine the two legends?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nCreate the two following stacked bar plots.

We have all been writing R code for years, but every day we still write code that doesn’t work on the first try!\nStart by carefully comparing the code that you’re running to the code in the book. R is extremely picky, and a misplaced character can make all the difference. Make sure that every ( is matched with a ) and every \" is paired with another \". Sometimes you’ll run the code and nothing happens. Check the left-hand of your console: if it’s a +, it means that R doesn’t think you’ve typed a complete expression and it’s waiting for you to finish it. In this case, it’s usually easy to start from scratch again by pressing ESCAPE to abort processing the current command.\nOne common problem when creating ggplot2 graphics is to put the + in the wrong place: it has to come at the end of the line, not the start. In other words, make sure you haven’t accidentally written code like this:\nggplot(data = mpg)\n+ geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))\nIf you’re still stuck, try the help. You can get help about any R function by running ?function_name in the console, or highlighting the function name and pressing F1 in RStudio. Don’t worry if the help doesn’t seem that helpful - instead skip down to the examples and look for code that matches what you’re trying to do.\nIf that doesn’t help, carefully read the error message. Sometimes the answer will be buried there! But when you’re new to R, even if the answer is in the error message, you might not yet know how to understand it. Another great tool is Google: try googling the error message, as it’s likely someone else has had the same problem, and has gotten help online.",

But as the code you’re writing gets more complex, comments can save you (and your collaborators) a lot of time figuring out what was done in the code.\nUse comments to explain the why of your code, not the how or the what. The what and how of your code are always possible to figure out, even if it might be tedious, by carefully reading it. If you describe every step in the comments, and then change the code, you will have to remember to update the comments as well or it will be confusing when you return to your code in the future.\nFiguring out why something was done is much more difficult, if not impossible. For example, geom_smooth() has an argument called span, which controls the smoothness of the curve, with larger values yielding a smoother curve. Suppose you decide to change the value of span from its default of 0.75 to 0.9: it’s easy for a future reader to understand what is happening, but unless you note your thinking in a comment, no one will understand why you changed the default.\nFor data analysis code, use comments to explain your overall plan of attack and record important insights as you encounter them.

You’ll learn how to do all that (and more!) in this chapter, which will introduce you to data transformation using the dplyr package and a new dataset on flights that departed from New York City in 2013.\nThe goal of this chapter is to give you an overview of all the key tools for transforming a data frame. We’ll start with functions that operate on rows and then columns of a data frame, then circle back to talk more about the pipe, an important tool that you use to combine verbs. We will then introduce the ability to work with groups. We will end the chapter with a case study that showcases these functions in action and we’ll come back to the functions in more detail in later chapters, as we start to dig into specific types of data (e.g., numbers, strings, dates).",

We’ll illustrate the key ideas using data from the nycflights13 package, and use ggplot2 to help us understand the data.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTake careful note of the conflicts message that’s printed when you load the tidyverse. It tells you that dplyr overwrites some functions in base R. If you want to use the base version of these functions after loading dplyr, you’ll need to use their full names: stats::filter() and stats::lag(). So far we’ve mostly ignored which package a function comes from because most of the time it doesn’t matter. However, knowing the package can help you find help and find related functions, so when we need to be precise about which package a function comes from, we’ll use the same syntax as R: packagename::functionname().\n\n3.1.2 nycflights13\nTo explore the basic dplyr verbs, we’re going to use nycflights13::flights. This dataset contains all 336,776 flights that departed from New York City in 2013. The data comes from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and is documented in ?flights.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nflights is a tibble, a special type of data frame used by the tidyverse to avoid some common gotchas. The most important difference between tibbles and data frames is the way tibbles print; they are designed for large datasets, so they only show the first few rows and only the columns that fit on one screen. There are a few options to see everything. If you’re using RStudio, the most convenient is probably View(flights), which will open an interactive scrollable and filterable view. Otherwise you can use print(flights, width = Inf) to show all columns, or use glimpse():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn both views, the variables names are followed by abbreviations that tell you the type of each variable: &lt;int&gt; is short for integer, &lt;dbl&gt; is short for double (aka real numbers), &lt;chr&gt; for character (aka strings), and &lt;dttm&gt; for date-time. These are important because the operations you can perform on a column depend so much on its “type”.\n\n3.1.3 dplyr basics\nYou’re about to learn the primary dplyr verbs (functions) which will allow you to solve the vast majority of your data manipulation challenges. But before we discuss their individual differences, it’s worth stating what they have in common:\n\nThe first argument is always a data frame.\nThe subsequent arguments typically describe which columns to operate on, using the variable names (without quotes).\nThe output is always a new data frame.\n\nBecause each verb does one thing well, solving complex problems will usually require combining multiple verbs, and we’ll do so with the pipe, |&gt;. We’ll discuss the pipe more in Section 3.4, but in brief, the pipe takes the thing on its left and passes it along to the function on its right so that x |&gt; f(y) is equivalent to f(x, y), and x |&gt; f(y) |&gt; g(z) is equivalent to g(f(x, y), z). The easiest way to pronounce the pipe is “then”. That makes it possible to get a sense of the following code even though you haven’t yet learned the details:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\ndplyr’s verbs are organized into four groups based on what they operate on: rows, columns, groups, or tables. In the following sections you’ll learn the most important verbs for rows, columns, and groups, then we’ll come back to the join verbs that work on tables in Chapter 19. Let’s dive in!",

    "section": "\n3.2 Rows",
    "text": "3.2 Rows\nThe most important verbs that operate on rows of a dataset are filter(), which changes which rows are present without changing their order, and arrange(), which changes the order of the rows without changing which are present. Both functions only affect the rows, and the columns are left unchanged. We’ll also discuss distinct() which finds rows with unique values but unlike arrange() and filter() it can also optionally modify the columns.\n\n3.2.1 filter()\n\nfilter() allows you to keep rows based on the values of the columns1. The first argument is the data frame. The second and subsequent arguments are the conditions that must be true to keep the row. For example, we could find all flights that departed more than 120 minutes (two hours) late:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAs well as &gt; (greater than), you can use &gt;= (greater than or equal to), &lt; (less than), &lt;= (less than or equal to), == (equal to), and != (not equal to). You can also combine conditions with & or , to indicate “and” (check for both conditions) or with | to indicate “or” (check for either condition):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere’s a useful shortcut when you’re combining | and ==: %in%. It keeps rows where the variable equals one of the values on the right:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe’ll come back to these comparisons and logical operators in more detail in Chapter 12.\nWhen you run filter() dplyr executes the filtering operation, creating a new data frame, and then prints it. It doesn’t modify the existing flights dataset because dplyr functions never modify their inputs. To save the result, you need to use the assignment operator, &lt;-:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n3.2.2 Common mistakes\nWhen you’re starting out with R, the easiest mistake to make is to use = instead of == when testing for equality. filter() will let you know when this happens:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnother mistakes is you write “or” statements like you would in English:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis “works”, in the sense that it doesn’t throw an error, but it doesn’t do what you want because | first checks the condition month == 1 and then checks the condition 2, which is not a sensible condition to check. We’ll learn more about what’s happening here and why in Section 12.3.2.\n\n3.2.3 arrange()\n\narrange() changes the order of the rows based on the value of the columns. It takes a data frame and a set of column names (or more complicated expressions) to order by. If you provide more than one column name, each additional column will be used to break ties in the values of preceding columns. For example, the following code sorts by the departure time, which is spread over four columns. We get the earliest years first, then within a year the earliest months, etc.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can use desc() on a column inside of arrange() to re-order the data frame based on that column in descending (big-to-small) order. For example, this code orders flights from most to least delayed:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that the number of rows has not changed – we’re only arranging the data, we’re not filtering it.\n\n3.2.4 distinct()\n\ndistinct() finds all the unique rows in a dataset, so in a technical sense, it primarily operates on the rows. Most of the time, however, you’ll want the distinct combination of some variables, so you can also optionally supply column names:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAlternatively, if you want to the keep other columns when filtering for unique rows, you can use the .keep_all = TRUE option.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s not a coincidence that all of these distinct flights are on January 1: distinct() will find the first occurrence of a unique row in the dataset and discard the rest.\nIf you want to find the number of occurrences instead, you’re better off swapping distinct() for count(), and with the sort = TRUE argument you can arrange them in descending order of number of occurrences. You’ll learn more about count in Section 13.3.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n3.2.5 Exercises\n\n\nIn a single pipeline for each condition, find all flights that meet the condition:\n\nHad an arrival delay of two or more hours\nFlew to Houston (IAH or HOU)\nWere operated by United, American, or Delta\nDeparted in summer (July, August, and September)\nArrived more than two hours late, but didn’t leave late\nWere delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight\n\n\nSort flights to find the flights with longest departure delays. Find the flights that left earliest in the morning.\nSort flights to find the fastest flights. (Hint: Try including a math calculation inside of your function.)\nWas there a flight on every day of 2013?\nWhich flights traveled the farthest distance? Which traveled the least distance?\nDoes it matter what order you used filter() and arrange() if you’re using both? Why/why not?

    "text": "3.3 Columns\nThere are four important verbs that affect the columns without changing the rows: mutate() creates new columns that are derived from the existing columns, select() changes which columns are present, rename() changes the names of the columns, and relocate() changes the positions of the columns.\n\n3.3.1 mutate()\n\nThe job of mutate() is to add new columns that are calculated from the existing columns. In the transform chapters, you’ll learn a large set of functions that you can use to manipulate different types of variables. For now, we’ll stick with basic algebra, which allows us to compute the gain, how much time a delayed flight made up in the air, and the speed in miles per hour:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBy default, mutate() adds new columns on the right hand side of your dataset, which makes it difficult to see what’s happening here. We can use the .before argument to instead add the variables to the left hand side2:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe . is a sign that .before is an argument to the function, not the name of a third new variable we are creating. You can also use .after to add after a variable, and in both .before and .after you can use the variable name instead of a position. For example, we could add the new variables after day:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAlternatively, you can control which variables are kept with the .keep argument. A particularly useful argument is \"used\" which specifies that we only keep the columns that were involved or created in the mutate() step. For example, the following output will contain only the variables dep_delay, arr_delay, air_time, gain, hours, and gain_per_hour.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that since we haven’t assigned the result of the above computation back to flights, the new variables gain, hours, and gain_per_hour will only be printed but will not be stored in a data frame. And if we want them to be available in a data frame for future use, we should think carefully about whether we want the result to be assigned back to flights, overwriting the original data frame with many more variables, or to a new object. Often, the right answer is a new object that is named informatively to indicate its contents, e.g., delay_gain, but you might also have good reasons for overwriting flights.\n\n3.3.2 select()\n\nIt’s not uncommon to get datasets with hundreds or even thousands of variables. In this situation, the first challenge is often just focusing on the variables you’re interested in. select() allows you to rapidly zoom in on a useful subset using operations based on the names of the variables:\n\n\nSelect columns by name:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nSelect all columns between year and day (inclusive):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nSelect all columns except those from year to day (inclusive):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHistorically this operation was done with - instead of !, so you’re likely to see that in the wild. These two operators serve the same purpose but with subtle differences in behavior. We recommend using ! because it reads as “not” and combines well with & and |.\n\n\nSelect all columns that are characters:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nThere are a number of helper functions you can use within select():\n\n\nstarts_with(\"abc\"): matches names that begin with “abc”.\n\nends_with(\"xyz\"): matches names that end with “xyz”.\n\ncontains(\"ijk\"): matches names that contain “ijk”.\n\nnum_range(\"x\", 1:3): matches x1, x2 and x3.\n\nSee ?select for more details. Once you know regular expressions (the topic of Chapter 15) you’ll also be able to use matches() to select variables that match a pattern.\nYou can rename variables as you select() them by using =. The new name appears on the left hand side of the =, and the old variable appears on the right hand side:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n3.3.3 rename()\n\nIf you want to keep all the existing variables and just want to rename a few, you can use rename() instead of select():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you have a bunch of inconsistently named columns and it would be painful to fix them all by hand, check out janitor::clean_names() which provides some useful automated cleaning.\n\n3.3.4 relocate()\n\nUse relocate() to move variables around. You might want to collect related variables together or move important variables to the front. By default relocate() moves variables to the front:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also specify where to put them using the .before and .after arguments, just like in mutate():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n3.3.5 Exercises\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nCompare dep_time, sched_dep_time, and dep_delay.

So why do we recommend the base pipe? Firstly, because it’s part of base R, it’s always available for you to use, even when you’re not using the tidyverse. Secondly, |&gt; is quite a bit simpler than %&gt;%: in the time between the invention of %&gt;% in 2014 and the inclusion of |&gt; in R 4.1.0 in 2021, we gained a better understanding of the pipe. This allowed the base implementation to jettison infrequently used and less important features.",

    "section": "\n3.5 Groups",
    "text": "3.5 Groups\nSo far you’ve learned about functions that work with rows and columns. dplyr gets even more powerful when you add in the ability to work with groups. In this section, we’ll focus on the most important functions: group_by(), summarize(), and the slice family of functions.\n\n3.5.1 group_by()\n\nUse group_by() to divide your dataset into groups meaningful for your analysis:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\ngroup_by() doesn’t change the data but, if you look closely at the output, you’ll notice that the output indicates that it is “grouped by” month (Groups: month [12]). This means subsequent operations will now work “by month”. group_by() adds this grouped feature (referred to as class) to the data frame, which changes the behavior of the subsequent verbs applied to the data.\n\n3.5.2 summarize()\n\nThe most important grouped operation is a summary, which, if being used to calculate a single summary statistic, reduces the data frame to have a single row for each group. In dplyr, this operation is performed by summarize()3, as shown by the following example, which computes the average departure delay by month:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUhoh! Something has gone wrong and all of our results are NAs (pronounced “N-A”), R’s symbol for missing value. This happened because some of the observed flights had missing data in the delay column, and so when we calculated the mean including those values, we got an NA result. We’ll come back to discuss missing values in detail in Chapter 18, but for now we’ll tell the mean() function to ignore all missing values by setting the argument na.rm to TRUE:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can create any number of summaries in a single call to summarize(). You’ll learn various useful summaries in the upcoming chapters, but one very useful summary is n(), which returns the number of rows in each group:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nMeans and counts can get you a surprisingly long way in data science!\n\n3.5.3 The slice_ functions\nThere are five handy functions that allow you extract specific rows within each group:\n\n\ndf |&gt; slice_head(n = 1) takes the first row from each group.\n\ndf |&gt; slice_tail(n = 1) takes the last row in each group.\n\ndf |&gt; slice_min(x, n = 1) takes the row with the smallest value of column x.\n\ndf |&gt; slice_max(x, n = 1) takes the row with the largest value of column x.\n\ndf |&gt; slice_sample(n = 1) takes one random row.\n\nYou can vary n to select more than one row, or instead of n =, you can use prop = 0.1 to select (e.g.) 10% of the rows in each group. For example, the following code finds the flights that are most delayed upon arrival at each destination:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that there are 105 destinations but we get 108 rows here. What’s up? slice_min() and slice_max() keep tied values so n = 1 means give us all rows with the highest value. If you want exactly one row per group you can set with_ties = FALSE.\nThis is similar to computing the max delay with summarize(), but you get the whole corresponding row (or rows if there’s a tie) instead of the single summary statistic.\n\n3.5.4 Grouping by multiple variables\nYou can create groups using more than one variable. For example, we could make a group for each date.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen you summarize a tibble grouped by more than one variable, each summary peels off the last group. In hindsight, this wasn’t a great way to make this function work, but it’s difficult to change without breaking existing code. To make it obvious what’s happening, dplyr displays a message that tells you how you can change this behavior:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you’re happy with this behavior, you can explicitly request it in order to suppress the message:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAlternatively, change the default behavior by setting a different value, e.g., \"drop\" to drop all grouping or \"keep\" to preserve the same groups.\n\n3.5.5 Ungrouping\nYou might also want to remove grouping from a data frame without using summarize(). You can do this with ungroup().\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow let’s see what happens when you summarize an ungrouped data frame.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou get a single row back because dplyr treats all the rows in an ungrouped data frame as belonging to one group.\n\n3.5.6 .by\n\ndplyr 1.1.0 includes a new, experimental, syntax for per-operation grouping, the .by argument. group_by() and ungroup() aren’t going away, but you can now also use the .by argument to group within a single operation:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr if you want to group by multiple variables:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n.by works with all verbs and has the advantage that you don’t need to use the .groups argument to suppress the grouping message or ungroup() when you’re done.\nWe didn’t focus on this syntax in this chapter because it was very new when we wrote the book. We did want to mention it because we think it has a lot of promise and it’s likely to be quite popular. You can learn more about it in the dplyr 1.1.0 blog post.\n\n3.5.7 Exercises\n\nWhich carrier has the worst average delays? Challenge: can you disentangle the effects of bad airports vs. bad carriers? Why/why not? (Hint: think about flights |&gt; group_by(carrier, dest) |&gt; summarize(n()))\nFind the flights that are most delayed upon departure from each destination.\nHow do delays vary over the course of the day. Illustrate your answer with a plot.\nWhat happens if you supply a negative n to slice_min() and friends?\nExplain what count() does in terms of the dplyr verbs you just learned. What does the sort argument to count() do?\n\nSuppose we have the following tiny data frame:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nWrite down what you think the output will look like, then check if you were correct, and describe what group_by() does.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nWrite down what you think the output will look like, then check if you were correct, and describe what arrange() does.

Unfortunately, however, most real data is untidy. There are two main reasons:\n\nData is often organized to facilitate some goal other than analysis. For example, it’s common for data to be structured to make data entry, not analysis, easy.\nMost people aren’t familiar with the principles of tidy data, and it’s hard to derive them yourself unless you spend a lot of time working with data.\n\nThis means that most real analyses will require at least a little tidying. You’ll begin by figuring out what the underlying variables and observations are. Sometimes this is easy; other times you’ll need to consult with the people who originally generated the data. Next, you’ll pivot your data into a tidy form, with variables in the columns and observations in the rows.\ntidyr provides two functions for pivoting data: pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(). We’ll first start with pivot_longer() because it’s the most common case. Let’s dive into some examples.\n\n5.3.1 Data in column names\nThe billboard dataset records the billboard rank of songs in the year 2000:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this dataset, each observation is a song. The first three columns (artist, track and date.entered) are variables that describe the song. Then we have 76 columns (wk1-wk76) that describe the rank of the song in each week1. Here, the column names are one variable (the week) and the cell values are another (the rank).\nTo tidy this data, we’ll use pivot_longer():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAfter the data, there are three key arguments:\n\n\ncols specifies which columns need to be pivoted, i.e. which columns aren’t variables. This argument uses the same syntax as select() so here we could use !c(artist, track, date.entered) or starts_with(\"wk\").\n\nnames_to names the variable stored in the column names, we named that variable week.\n\nvalues_to names the variable stored in the cell values, we named that variable rank.\n\nNote that in the code \"week\" and \"rank\" are quoted because those are new variables we’re creating, they don’t yet exist in the data when we run the pivot_longer() call.\nNow let’s turn our attention to the resulting, longer data frame. What happens if a song is in the top 100 for less than 76 weeks? Take 2 Pac’s “Baby Don’t Cry”, for example. The above output suggests that it was only in the top 100 for 7 weeks, and all the remaining weeks are filled in with missing values. These NAs don’t really represent unknown observations; they were forced to exist by the structure of the dataset2, so we can ask pivot_longer() to get rid of them by setting values_drop_na = TRUE:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe number of rows is now much lower, indicating that many rows with NAs were dropped.\nYou might also wonder what happens if a song is in the top 100 for more than 76 weeks? We can’t tell from this data, but you might guess that additional columns wk77, wk78, … would be added to the dataset.\nThis data is now tidy, but we could make future computation a bit easier by converting values of week from character strings to numbers using mutate() and readr::parse_number(). parse_number() is a handy function that will extract the first number from a string, ignoring all other text.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow that we have all the week numbers in one variable and all the rank values in another, we’re in a good position to visualize how song ranks vary over time. The code is shown below and the result is in ?fig-billboard-ranks. We can see that very few songs stay in the top 100 for more than 20 weeks.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n5.3.2 How does pivoting work?\nNow that you’ve seen how we can use pivoting to reshape our data, let’s take a little time to gain some intuition about what pivoting does to the data. Let’s start with a very simple dataset to make it easier to see what’s happening. Suppose we have three patients with ids A, B, and C, and we take two blood pressure measurements on each patient. We’ll create the data with tribble(), a handy function for constructing small tibbles by hand:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe want our new dataset to have three variables: id (already exists), measurement (the column names), and value (the cell values). To achieve this, we need to pivot df longer:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHow does the reshaping work? It’s easier to see if we think about it column by column. As shown in Figure 5.2, the values in a column that was already a variable in the original dataset (id) need to be repeated, once for each column that is pivoted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Columns that are already variables need to be repeated, once for each column that is pivoted.\n\n\n\n\nThe column names become values in a new variable, whose name is defined by names_to, as shown in Figure 5.3. They need to be repeated once for each row in the original dataset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: The column names of pivoted columns become values in a new column. The values need to be repeated once for each row of the original dataset.\n\n\n\n\nThe cell values also become values in a new variable, with a name defined by values_to. They are unwound row by row. Figure 5.4 illustrates the process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: The number of values is preserved (not repeated), but unwound row-by-row.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Many variables in column names\nA more challenging situation occurs when you have multiple pieces of information crammed into the column names, and you would like to store these in separate new variables. For example, take the who2 dataset, the source of table1 and friends that you saw above:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis dataset, collected by the World Health Organisation, records information about tuberculosis diagnoses. There are two columns that are already variables and are easy to interpret: country and year. They are followed by 56 columns like sp_m_014, ep_m_4554, and rel_m_3544. If you stare at these columns for long enough, you’ll notice there’s a pattern. Each column name is made up of three pieces separated by _. The first piece, sp/rel/ep, describes the method used for the diagnosis, the second piece, m/f is the gender (coded as a binary variable in this dataset), and the third piece, 014/1524/2534/3544/4554/5564/65 is the age range (014 represents 0-14, for example).\nSo in this case we have six pieces of information recorded in who2: the country and the year (already columns); the method of diagnosis, the gender category, and the age range category (contained in the other column names); and the count of patients in that category (cell values). To organize these six pieces of information in six separate columns, we use pivot_longer() with a vector of column names for names_to and instructors for splitting the original variable names into pieces for names_sep as well as a column name for values_to:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAn alternative to names_sep is names_pattern, which you can use to extract variables from more complicated naming scenarios, once you’ve learned about regular expressions in Chapter 15.\nConceptually, this is only a minor variation on the simpler case you’ve already seen. Figure 5.5 shows the basic idea: now, instead of the column names pivoting into a single column, they pivot into multiple columns. You can imagine this happening in two steps (first pivoting and then separating) but under the hood it happens in a single step because that’s faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Pivoting columns with multiple pieces of information in the names means that each column name now fills in values in multiple output columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3.4 Data and variable names in the column headers\nThe next step up in complexity is when the column names include a mix of variable values and variable names. For example, take the household dataset:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis dataset contains data about five families, with the names and dates of birth of up to two children. The new challenge in this dataset is that the column names contain the names of two variables (dob, name) and the values of another (child, with values 1 or 2). To solve this problem we again need to supply a vector to names_to but this time we use the special \".value\" sentinel; this isn’t the name of a variable but a unique value that tells pivot_longer() to do something different. This overrides the usual values_to argument to use the first component of the pivoted column name as a variable name in the output.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe again use values_drop_na = TRUE, since the shape of the input forces the creation of explicit missing variables (e.g., for families with only one child).\nFigure 5.6 illustrates the basic idea with a simpler example. When you use \".value\" in names_to, the column names in the input contribute to both values and variable names in the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: Pivoting with names_to = c(\".value\", \"num\") splits the column names into two components: the first part determines the output column name (x or y), and the second part determines the value of the num column.",

    "text": "5.4 Widening data\nSo far we’ve used pivot_longer() to solve the common class of problems where values have ended up in column names. Next we’ll pivot (HA HA) to pivot_wider(), which makes datasets wider by increasing columns and reducing rows and helps when one observation is spread across multiple rows. This seems to arise less commonly in the wild, but it does seem to crop up a lot when dealing with governmental data.\nWe’ll start by looking at cms_patient_experience, a dataset from the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid services that collects data about patient experiences:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe core unit being studied is an organization, but each organization is spread across six rows, with one row for each measurement taken in the survey organization. We can see the complete set of values for measure_cd and measure_title by using distinct():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNeither of these columns will make particularly great variable names: measure_cd doesn’t hint at the meaning of the variable and measure_title is a long sentence containing spaces. We’ll use measure_cd as the source for our new column names for now, but in a real analysis you might want to create your own variable names that are both short and meaningful.\npivot_wider() has the opposite interface to pivot_longer(): instead of choosing new column names, we need to provide the existing columns that define the values (values_from) and the column name (names_from):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe output doesn’t look quite right; we still seem to have multiple rows for each organization. That’s because, we also need to tell pivot_wider() which column or columns have values that uniquely identify each row; in this case those are the variables starting with \"org\":\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis gives us the output that we’re looking for.\n\n5.4.1 How does pivot_wider() work?\nTo understand how pivot_wider() works, let’s again start with a very simple dataset. This time we have two patients with ids A and B, we have three blood pressure measurements on patient A and two on patient B:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe’ll take the values from the value column and the names from the measurement column:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo begin the process pivot_wider() needs to first figure out what will go in the rows and columns. The new column names will be the unique values of measurement.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBy default, the rows in the output are determined by all the variables that aren’t going into the new names or values. These are called the id_cols. Here there is only one column, but in general there can be any number.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\npivot_wider() then combines these results to generate an empty data frame:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt then fills in all the missing values using the data in the input. In this case, not every cell in the output has a corresponding value in the input as there’s no third blood pressure measurement for patient B, so that cell remains missing. We’ll come back to this idea that pivot_wider() can “make” missing values in Chapter 18.\nYou might also wonder what happens if there are multiple rows in the input that correspond to one cell in the output. The example below has two rows that correspond to id “A” and measurement “bp1”:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf we attempt to pivot this we get an output that contains list-columns, which you’ll learn more about in Chapter 23:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSince you don’t know how to work with this sort of data yet, you’ll want to follow the hint in the warning to figure out where the problem is:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s then up to you to figure out what’s gone wrong with your data and either repair the underlying damage or use your grouping and summarizing skills to ensure that each combination of row and column values only has a single row.",

    "text": "5.5 Summary\nIn this chapter you learned about tidy data: data that has variables in columns and observations in rows. Tidy data makes working in the tidyverse easier, because it’s a consistent structure understood by most functions, the main challenge is transforming the data from whatever structure you receive it in to a tidy format. To that end, you learned about pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() which allow you to tidy up many untidy datasets. The examples we presented here are a selection of those from vignette(\"pivot\", package = \"tidyr\"), so if you encounter a problem that this chapter doesn’t help you with, that vignette is a good place to try next.\nAnother challenge is that, for a given dataset, it can be impossible to label the longer or the wider version as the “tidy” one. This is partly a reflection of our definition of tidy data, where we said tidy data has one variable in each column, but we didn’t actually define what a variable is (and it’s surprisingly hard to do so). It’s totally fine to be pragmatic and to say a variable is whatever makes your analysis easiest. So if you’re stuck figuring out how to do some computation, consider switching up the organisation of your data; don’t be afraid to untidy, transform, and re-tidy as needed!\nIf you enjoyed this chapter and want to learn more about the underlying theory, you can learn more about the history and theoretical underpinnings in the Tidy Data paper published in the Journal of Statistical Software.\nNow that you’re writing a substantial amount of R code, it’s time to learn more about organizing your code into files and directories. In the next chapter, you’ll learn all about the advantages of scripts and projects, and some of the many tools that they provide to make your life easier.",

That’s a great place to start, but you’ll find it gets cramped pretty quickly as you create more complex ggplot2 graphics and longer dplyr pipelines. To give yourself more room to work, use the script editor. Open it up by clicking the File menu, selecting New File, then R script, or using the keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + N. Now you’ll see four panes, as in Figure 6.1. The script editor is a great place to experiment with your code. When you want to change something, you don’t have to re-type the whole thing, you can just edit the script and re-run it. And once you have written code that works and does what you want, you can save it as a script file to easily return to later.\nFigure 6.1: Opening the script editor adds a new pane at the top-left of the IDE.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "6.1.1 Running code\nThe script editor is an excellent place for building complex ggplot2 plots or long sequences of dplyr manipulations. The key to using the script editor effectively is to memorize one of the most important keyboard shortcuts: Cmd/Ctrl + Enter. This executes the current R expression in the console. For example, take the code below.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(nycflights13)\n\nnot_cancelled &lt;- flights |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(dep_delay)█, !is.na(arr_delay))\n\nnot_cancelled |&gt;\n  group_by(year, month, day) |&gt;\n  summarize(mean = mean(dep_delay))\n\nIf your cursor is at █, pressing Cmd/Ctrl + Enter will run the complete command that generates not_cancelled. It will also move the cursor to the following statement (beginning with not_cancelled |&gt;). That makes it easy to step through your complete script by repeatedly pressing Cmd/Ctrl + Enter.\nInstead of running your code expression-by-expression, you can also execute the complete script in one step with Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S. Doing this regularly is a great way to ensure that you’ve captured all the important parts of your code in the script.\nWe recommend you always start your script with the packages you need. That way, if you share your code with others, they can easily see which packages they need to install. Note, however, that you should never include install.packages() in a script you share. It’s inconsiderate to hand off a script that will change something on their computer if they’re not being careful!\nWhen working through future chapters, we highly recommend starting in the script editor and practicing your keyboard shortcuts. Over time, sending code to the console in this way will become so natural that you won’t even think about it.\n\n6.1.2 RStudio diagnostics\nIn the script editor, RStudio will highlight syntax errors with a red squiggly line and a cross in the sidebar:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHover over the cross to see what the problem is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio will also let you know about potential problems:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Saving and naming\nRStudio automatically saves the contents of the script editor when you quit, and automatically reloads it when you re-open. Nevertheless, it’s a good idea to avoid Untitled1, Untitled2, Untitled3, and so on and instead save your scripts and to give them informative names.\nIt might be tempting to name your files code.R or myscript.R, but you should think a bit harder before choosing a name for your file. Three important principles for file naming are as follows:\n\nFile names should be machine readable: avoid spaces, symbols, and special characters. Don’t rely on case sensitivity to distinguish files.\nFile names should be human readable: use file names to describe what’s in the file.\nFile names should play well with default ordering: start file names with numbers so that alphabetical sorting puts them in the order they get used.\n\nFor example, suppose you have the following files in a project folder.\nalternative model.R\ncode for exploratory analysis.r\nfinalreport.qmd\nFinalReport.qmd\nfig 1.png\nFigure_02.png\nmodel_first_try.R\nrun-first.r\ntemp.txt\nThere are a variety of problems here: it’s hard to find which file to run first, file names contain spaces, there are two files with the same name but different capitalization (finalreport vs. FinalReport1), and some names don’t describe their contents (run-first and temp).\nHere’s a better way of naming and organizing the same set of files:\n01-load-data.R\n02-exploratory-analysis.R\n03-model-approach-1.R\n04-model-approach-2.R\nfig-01.png\nfig-02.png\nreport-2022-03-20.qmd\nreport-2022-04-02.qmd\nreport-draft-notes.txt\nNumbering the key scripts make it obvious in which order to run them and a consistent naming scheme makes it easier to see what varies. Additionally, the figures are labelled similarly, the reports are distinguished by dates included in the file names, and temp is renamed to report-draft-notes to better describe its contents. If you have a lot of files in a directory, taking organization one step further and placing different types of files (scripts, figures, etc.) in different directories is recommended.",

    "text": "6.2 Projects\nOne day, you will need to quit R, go do something else, and return to your analysis later. One day, you will be working on multiple analyses simultaneously and you want to keep them separate. One day, you will need to bring data from the outside world into R and send numerical results and figures from R back out into the world.\nTo handle these real life situations, you need to make two decisions:\n\nWhat is the source of truth? What will you save as your lasting record of what happened?\nWhere does your analysis live?\n\n\n6.2.1 What is the source of truth?\nAs a beginner, it’s okay to rely on your current Environment to contain all the objects you have created throughout your analysis. However, to make it easier to work on larger projects or collaborate with others, your source of truth should be the R scripts. With your R scripts (and your data files), you can recreate the environment. With only your environment, it’s much harder to recreate your R scripts: you’ll either have to retype a lot of code from memory (inevitably making mistakes along the way) or you’ll have to carefully mine your R history.\nTo help keep your R scripts as the source of truth for your analysis, we highly recommend that you instruct RStudio not to preserve your workspace between sessions. You can do this either by running usethis::use_blank_slate()2 or by mimicking the options shown in Figure 6.2. This will cause you some short-term pain, because now when you restart RStudio, it will no longer remember the code that you ran last time nor will the objects you created or the datasets you read be available to use. But this short-term pain saves you long-term agony because it forces you to capture all important procedures in your code. There’s nothing worse than discovering three months after the fact that you’ve only stored the results of an important calculation in your environment, not the calculation itself in your code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Copy these options in your RStudio options to always start your RStudio session with a clean slate.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a great pair of keyboard shortcuts that will work together to make sure you’ve captured the important parts of your code in the editor:\n\nPress Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + 0/F10 to restart R.\nPress Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + S to re-run the current script.\n\nWe collectively use this pattern hundreds of times a week.\nAlternatively, if you don’t use keyboard shortcuts, you can go to Session &gt; Restart R and then highlight and re-run your current script.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio server\n\n\n\nIf you’re using RStudio server, your R session is never restarted by default. When you close your RStudio server tab, it might feel like you’re closing R, but the server actually keeps it running in the background. The next time you return, you’ll be in exactly the same place you left. This makes it even more important to regularly restart R so that you’re starting with a clean slate.\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Where does your analysis live?\nR has a powerful notion of the working directory. This is where R looks for files that you ask it to load, and where it will put any files that you ask it to save. RStudio shows your current working directory at the top of the console:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you can print this out in R code by running getwd():\n\ngetwd()\n#&gt; [1] \"/Users/hadley/Documents/r4ds\"\n\nIn this R session, the current working directory (think of it as “home”) is in hadley’s Documents folder, in a subfolder called r4ds. This code will return a different result when you run it, because your computer has a different directory structure than Hadley’s!\nAs a beginning R user, it’s OK to let your working directory be your home directory, documents directory, or any other weird directory on your computer. But you’re more than a handful of chapters into this book, and you’re no longer a beginner. Very soon now you should evolve to organizing your projects into directories and, when working on a project, set R’s working directory to the associated directory.\nYou can set the working directory from within R but we do not recommend it:\n\nsetwd(\"/path/to/my/CoolProject\")\n\nThere’s a better way; a way that also puts you on the path to managing your R work like an expert. That way is the RStudio project.\n\n6.2.3 RStudio projects\nKeeping all the files associated with a given project (input data, R scripts, analytical results, and figures) together in one directory is such a wise and common practice that RStudio has built-in support for this via projects. Let’s make a project for you to use while you’re working through the rest of this book. Click File &gt; New Project, then follow the steps shown in Figure 6.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: To create new project: (top) first click New Directory, then (middle) click New Project, then (bottom) fill in the directory (project) name, choose a good subdirectory for its home and click Create Project.\n\n\n\n\nCall your project r4ds and think carefully about which subdirectory you put the project in. If you don’t store it somewhere sensible, it will be hard to find it in the future!\nOnce this process is complete, you’ll get a new RStudio project just for this book. Check that the “home” of your project is the current working directory:\n\ngetwd()\n#&gt; [1] /Users/hadley/Documents/r4ds\n\nNow enter the following commands in the script editor, and save the file, calling it “diamonds.R”. Then, create a new folder called “data”. You can do this by clicking on the “New Folder” button in the Files pane in RStudio. Finally, run the complete script which will save a PNG and CSV file into your project directory. Don’t worry about the details, you’ll learn them later in the book.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + \n  geom_hex()\nggsave(\"diamonds.png\")\n\nwrite_csv(diamonds, \"data/diamonds.csv\")\n\nQuit RStudio. Inspect the folder associated with your project — notice the .Rproj file. Double-click that file to re-open the project. Notice you get back to where you left off: it’s the same working directory and command history, and all the files you were working on are still open. Because you followed our instructions above, you will, however, have a completely fresh environment, guaranteeing that you’re starting with a clean slate.\nIn your favorite OS-specific way, search your computer for diamonds.png and you will find the PNG (no surprise) but also the script that created it (diamonds.R). This is a huge win! One day, you will want to remake a figure or just understand where it came from. If you rigorously save figures to files with R code and never with the mouse or the clipboard, you will be able to reproduce old work with ease!\n\n6.2.4 Relative and absolute paths\nOnce you’re inside a project, you should only ever use relative paths not absolute paths. What’s the difference? A relative path is relative to the working directory, i.e. the project’s home. When Hadley wrote data/diamonds.csv above it was a shortcut for /Users/hadley/Documents/r4ds/data/diamonds.csv. But importantly, if Mine ran this code on her computer, it would point to /Users/Mine/Documents/r4ds/data/diamonds.csv. This is why relative paths are important: they’ll work regardless of where the R project folder ends up.\nAbsolute paths point to the same place regardless of your working directory. They look a little different depending on your operating system. On Windows they start with a drive letter (e.g., C:) or two backslashes (e.g., \\\\servername) and on Mac/Linux they start with a slash “/” (e.g., /users/hadley). You should never use absolute paths in your scripts, because they hinder sharing: no one else will have exactly the same directory configuration as you.\nThere’s another important difference between operating systems: how you separate the components of the path. Mac and Linux uses slashes (e.g., data/diamonds.csv) and Windows uses backslashes (e.g., data\\diamonds.csv). R can work with either type (no matter what platform you’re currently using), but unfortunately, backslashes mean something special to R, and to get a single backslash in the path, you need to type two backslashes! That makes life frustrating, so we recommend always using the Linux/Mac style with forward slashes.",

But as you accumulate more code across multiple projects, you’ll learn to appreciate how a little up front organisation can save you a bunch of time down the road.\nIn summary, scripts and projects give you a solid workflow that will serve you well in the future:\n\nCreate one RStudio project for each data analysis project.\nSave your scripts (with informative names) in the project, edit them, run them in bits or as a whole. Restart R frequently to make sure you’ve captured everything in your scripts.\nOnly ever use relative paths, not absolute paths.\n\nThen everything you need is in one place and cleanly separated from all the other projects that you are working on.\nSo far, we’ve worked with datasets bundled inside of R packages. This makes it easier to get some practice on pre-prepared data, but obviously your data won’t be available in this way. So in the next chapter, you’re going to learn how load data from disk into your R session using the readr package.",

    "section": "\n7.2 Reading data from a file",
    "text": "7.2 Reading data from a file\nTo begin, we’ll focus on the most common rectangular data file type: CSV, which is short for comma-separated values. Here is what a simple CSV file looks like. The first row, commonly called the header row, gives the column names, and the following six rows provide the data. The columns are separated, aka delimited, by commas.\n\n\nStudent ID,Full Name,favourite.food,mealPlan,AGE\n1,Sunil Huffmann,Strawberry yoghurt,Lunch only,4\n2,Barclay Lynn,French fries,Lunch only,5\n3,Jayendra Lyne,N/A,Breakfast and lunch,7\n4,Leon Rossini,Anchovies,Lunch only,\n5,Chidiegwu Dunkel,Pizza,Breakfast and lunch,five\n6,Güvenç Attila,Ice cream,Lunch only,6\n\n\nTable 7.1 shows a representation of the same data as a table.\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: Data from the students.csv file as a table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent ID\nFull Name\nfavourite.food\nmealPlan\nAGE\n\n\n\n1\nSunil Huffmann\nStrawberry yoghurt\nLunch only\n4\n\n\n2\nBarclay Lynn\nFrench fries\nLunch only\n5\n\n\n3\nJayendra Lyne\nN/A\nBreakfast and lunch\n7\n\n\n4\nLeon Rossini\nAnchovies\nLunch only\nNA\n\n\n5\nChidiegwu Dunkel\nPizza\nBreakfast and lunch\nfive\n\n\n6\nGüvenç Attila\nIce cream\nLunch only\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can read this file into R using read_csv(). The first argument is the most important: the path to the file. You can think about the path as the address of the file: the file is called students.csv and that it lives in the data folder.\n\nstudents &lt;- read_csv(\"data/students.csv\")\n\nRows: 6 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (4): Full Name, favourite.food, mealPlan, AGE\ndbl (1): Student ID\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nThe code above will work if you have the students.csv file in a data folder in your project. You can download the students.csv file from https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv or you can read it directly from that URL with:\n\nstudents &lt;- read_csv(\"https://pos.it/r4ds-students-csv\")\n\nWhen you run read_csv(), it prints out a message telling you the number of rows and columns of data, the delimiter that was used, and the column specifications (names of columns organized by the type of data the column contains). It also prints out some information about retrieving the full column specification and how to quiet this message. This message is an integral part of readr, and we’ll return to it in Section 7.3.\n\n7.2.1 Practical advice\nOnce you read data in, the first step usually involves transforming it in some way to make it easier to work with in the rest of your analysis. Let’s take another look at the students data with that in mind.\n\nstudents\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  `Student ID` `Full Name`      favourite.food     mealPlan            AGE  \n         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;\n1            1 Sunil Huffmann   Strawberry yoghurt Lunch only          4    \n2            2 Barclay Lynn     French fries       Lunch only          5    \n3            3 Jayendra Lyne    N/A                Breakfast and lunch 7    \n4            4 Leon Rossini     Anchovies          Lunch only          &lt;NA&gt; \n5            5 Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza              Breakfast and lunch five \n6            6 Güvenç Attila    Ice cream          Lunch only          6    \n\n\nIn the favourite.food column, there are a bunch of food items, and then the character string N/A, which should have been a real NA that R will recognize as “not available”. This is something we can address using the na argument. By default, read_csv() only recognizes empty strings (\"\") in this dataset as NAs, and we want it to also recognize the character string \"N/A\".\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou might also notice that the Student ID and Full Name columns are surrounded by backticks. That’s because they contain spaces, breaking R’s usual rules for variable names; they’re non-syntactic names. To refer to these variables, you need to surround them with backticks, `:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAn alternative approach is to use janitor::clean_names() to use some heuristics to turn them all into snake case at once1.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnother common task after reading in data is to consider variable types. For example, meal_plan is a categorical variable with a known set of possible values, which in R should be represented as a factor:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that the values in the meal_plan variable have stayed the same, but the type of variable denoted underneath the variable name has changed from character (&lt;chr&gt;) to factor (&lt;fct&gt;). You’ll learn more about factors in Chapter 16.\nBefore you analyze these data, you’ll probably want to fix the age column. Currently, age is a character variable because one of the observations is typed out as five instead of a numeric 5. We discuss the details of fixing this issue in Chapter 20.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nA new function here is if_else(), which has three arguments. The first argument test should be a logical vector. The result will contain the value of the second argument, yes, when test is TRUE, and the value of the third argument, no, when it is FALSE. Here we’re saying if age is the character string \"five\", make it \"5\", and if not leave it as age. You will learn more about if_else() and logical vectors in Chapter 12.\n\n7.2.2 Other arguments\nThere are a couple of other important arguments that we need to mention, and they’ll be easier to demonstrate if we first show you a handy trick: read_csv() can read text strings that you’ve created and formatted like a CSV file:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUsually, read_csv() uses the first line of the data for the column names, which is a very common convention. But it’s not uncommon for a few lines of metadata to be included at the top of the file. You can use skip = n to skip the first n lines or use comment = \"#\" to drop all lines that start with (e.g.) #:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn other cases, the data might not have column names. You can use col_names = FALSE to tell read_csv() not to treat the first row as headings and instead label them sequentially from X1 to Xn:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAlternatively, you can pass col_names a character vector which will be used as the column names:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThese arguments are all you need to know to read the majority of CSV files that you’ll encounter in practice. (For the rest, you’ll need to carefully inspect your .csv file and read the documentation for read_csv()’s many other arguments.)\n\n7.2.3 Other file types\nOnce you’ve mastered read_csv(), using readr’s other functions is straightforward; it’s just a matter of knowing which function to reach for:\n\nread_csv2() reads semicolon-separated files. These use ; instead of , to separate fields and are common in countries that use , as the decimal marker.\nread_tsv() reads tab-delimited files.\nread_delim() reads in files with any delimiter, attempting to automatically guess the delimiter if you don’t specify it.\nread_fwf() reads fixed-width files. You can specify fields by their widths with fwf_widths() or by their positions with fwf_positions().\nread_table() reads a common variation of fixed-width files where columns are separated by white space.\nread_log() reads Apache-style log files.\n\n7.2.4 Exercises\n\nWhat function would you use to read a file where fields were separated with “|”?\nApart from file, skip, and comment, what other arguments do read_csv() and read_tsv() have in common?\nWhat are the most important arguments to read_fwf()?\n\nSometimes strings in a CSV file contain commas. To prevent them from causing problems, they need to be surrounded by a quoting character, like \" or '. By default, read_csv() assumes that the quoting character will be \". To read the following text into a data frame, what argument to read_csv() do you need to specify?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nIdentify what is wrong with each of the following inline CSV files. What happens when you run the code?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nPractice referring to non-syntactic names in the following data frame by:\n\nExtracting the variable called 1.\nPlotting a scatterplot of 1 vs. 2.\nCreating a new column called 3, which is 2 divided by 1.\nRenaming the columns to one, two, and three.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "section": "\n7.3 Controlling column types",
    "text": "7.3 Controlling column types\nA CSV file doesn’t contain any information about the type of each variable (i.e. whether it’s a logical, number, string, etc.), so readr will try to guess the type. This section describes how the guessing process works, how to resolve some common problems that cause it to fail, and, if needed, how to supply the column types yourself. Finally, we’ll mention a few general strategies that are useful if readr is failing catastrophically and you need to get more insight into the structure of your file.\n\n7.3.1 Guessing types\nreadr uses a heuristic to figure out the column types. For each column, it pulls the values of 1,0002 rows spaced evenly from the first row to the last, ignoring missing values. It then works through the following questions:\n\nDoes it contain only F, T, FALSE, or TRUE (ignoring case)? If so, it’s a logical.\nDoes it contain only numbers (e.g., 1, -4.5, 5e6, Inf)? If so, it’s a number.\nDoes it match the ISO8601 standard? If so, it’s a date or date-time. (We’ll return to date-times in more detail in Section 17.2).\nOtherwise, it must be a string.\n\nYou can see that behavior in action in this simple example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis heuristic works well if you have a clean dataset, but in real life, you’ll encounter a selection of weird and beautiful failures.\n\n7.3.2 Missing values, column types, and problems\nThe most common way column detection fails is that a column contains unexpected values, and you get a character column instead of a more specific type. One of the most common causes for this is a missing value, recorded using something other than the NA that readr expects.\nTake this simple 1 column CSV file as an example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf we read it without any additional arguments, x becomes a character column:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this very small case, you can easily see the missing value .. But what happens if you have thousands of rows with only a few missing values represented by .s sprinkled among them? One approach is to tell readr that x is a numeric column, and then see where it fails. You can do that with the col_types argument, which takes a named list where the names match the column names in the CSV file:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow read_csv() reports that there was a problem, and tells us we can find out more with problems():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis tells us that there was a problem in row 3, col 1 where readr expected a double but got a .. That suggests this dataset uses . for missing values. So then we set na = \".\", the automatic guessing succeeds, giving us the numeric column that we want:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n7.3.3 Column types\nreadr provides a total of nine column types for you to use:\n\n\ncol_logical() and col_double() read logicals and real numbers. They’re relatively rarely needed (except as above), since readr will usually guess them for you.\n\ncol_integer() reads integers. We seldom distinguish integers and doubles in this book because they’re functionally equivalent, but reading integers explicitly can occasionally be useful because they occupy half the memory of doubles.\n\ncol_character() reads strings. This can be useful to specify explicitly when you have a column that is a numeric identifier, i.e., long series of digits that identifies an object but doesn’t make sense to apply mathematical operations to. Examples include phone numbers, social security numbers, credit card numbers, etc.\n\ncol_factor(), col_date(), and col_datetime() create factors, dates, and date-times respectively; you’ll learn more about those when we get to those data types in Chapter 16 and Chapter 17.\n\ncol_number() is a permissive numeric parser that will ignore non-numeric components, and is particularly useful for currencies. You’ll learn more about it in Chapter 13.\n\ncol_skip() skips a column so it’s not included in the result, which can be useful for speeding up reading the data if you have a large CSV file and you only want to use some of the columns.\n\nIt’s also possible to override the default column by switching from list() to cols() and specifying .default:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnother useful helper is cols_only() which will read in only the columns you specify:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "7.4 Reading data from multiple files\nSometimes your data is split across multiple files instead of being contained in a single file. For example, you might have sales data for multiple months, with each month’s data in a separate file: 01-sales.csv for January, 02-sales.csv for February, and 03-sales.csv for March. With read_csv() you can read these data in at once and stack them on top of each other in a single data frame.\n\nsales_files &lt;- c(\"data/01-sales.csv\", \"data/02-sales.csv\", \"data/03-sales.csv\")\nread_csv(sales_files, id = \"file\")\n\n# A tibble: 19 × 6\n   file              month     year brand  item     n\n   &lt;chr&gt;             &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 data/01-sales.csv January   2019     1  1234     3\n 2 data/01-sales.csv January   2019     1  8721     9\n 3 data/01-sales.csv January   2019     1  1822     2\n 4 data/01-sales.csv January   2019     2  3333     1\n 5 data/01-sales.csv January   2019     2  2156     9\n 6 data/01-sales.csv January   2019     2  3987     6\n 7 data/01-sales.csv January   2019     2  3827     6\n 8 data/02-sales.csv February  2019     1  1234     8\n 9 data/02-sales.csv February  2019     1  8721     2\n10 data/02-sales.csv February  2019     1  1822     3\n11 data/02-sales.csv February  2019     2  3333     1\n12 data/02-sales.csv February  2019     2  2156     3\n13 data/02-sales.csv February  2019     2  3987     6\n14 data/03-sales.csv March     2019     1  1234     3\n15 data/03-sales.csv March     2019     1  3627     1\n16 data/03-sales.csv March     2019     1  8820     3\n17 data/03-sales.csv March     2019     2  7253     1\n18 data/03-sales.csv March     2019     2  8766     3\n19 data/03-sales.csv March     2019     2  8288     6\n\n\nOnce again, the code above will work if you have the CSV files in a data folder in your project. You can download these files from https://pos.it/r4ds-01-sales, https://pos.it/r4ds-02-sales, and https://pos.it/r4ds-03-sales or you can read them directly with:\n\nsales_files &lt;- c(\n  \"https://pos.it/r4ds-01-sales\",\n  \"https://pos.it/r4ds-02-sales\",\n  \"https://pos.it/r4ds-03-sales\"\n)\nread_csv(sales_files, id = \"file\")\n\nThe id argument adds a new column called file to the resulting data frame that identifies the file the data come from. This is especially helpful in circumstances where the files you’re reading in do not have an identifying column that can help you trace the observations back to their original sources.\nIf you have many files you want to read in, it can get cumbersome to write out their names as a list. Instead, you can use the base list.files() function to find the files for you by matching a pattern in the file names. You’ll learn more about these patterns in Chapter 15.\n\nsales_files &lt;- list.files(\"data\", pattern = \"sales\\\\.csv$\", full.names = TRUE)\nsales_files\n\n[1] \"data/01-sales.csv\" \"data/02-sales.csv\" \"data/03-sales.csv\"",

    "section": "8.2 Making a reprex",
    "text": "8.2 Making a reprex\nIf your googling doesn’t find anything useful, it’s a really good idea to prepare a reprex, short for minimal reproducible example. A good reprex makes it easier for other people to help you, and often you’ll figure out the problem yourself in the course of making it. There are two parts to creating a reprex:\n\nFirst, you need to make your code reproducible. This means that you need to capture everything, i.e. include any library() calls and create all necessary objects. The easiest way to make sure you’ve done this is using the reprex package.\nSecond, you need to make it minimal. Strip away everything that is not directly related to your problem. This usually involves creating a much smaller and simpler R object than the one you’re facing in real life or even using built-in data.\n\nThat sounds like a lot of work! And it can be, but it has a great payoff:\n\n80% of the time, creating an excellent reprex reveals the source of your problem. It’s amazing how often the process of writing up a self-contained and minimal example allows you to answer your own question.\nThe other 20% of the time, you will have captured the essence of your problem in a way that is easy for others to play with. This substantially improves your chances of getting help!\n\nWhen creating a reprex by hand, it’s easy to accidentally miss something, meaning your code can’t be run on someone else’s computer. Avoid this problem by using the reprex package, which is installed as part of the tidyverse. Let’s say you copy this code onto your clipboard (or, on RStudio Server or Cloud, select it):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThen call reprex(), where the default output is formatted for GitHub:\nreprex::reprex()\nA nicely rendered HTML preview will display in RStudio’s Viewer (if you’re in RStudio) or your default browser otherwise. The reprex is automatically copied to your clipboard (on RStudio Server or Cloud, you will need to copy this yourself):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis text is formatted in a special way, called Markdown, which can be pasted to sites like StackOverflow or Github and they will automatically render it to look like code. Here’s what that Markdown would look like rendered on GitHub:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnyone else can copy, paste, and run this immediately.\nThere are three things you need to include to make your example reproducible: required packages, data, and code.\n\nPackages should be loaded at the top of the script so it’s easy to see which ones the example needs. This is a good time to check that you’re using the latest version of each package; you may have discovered a bug that’s been fixed since you installed or last updated the package. For packages in the tidyverse, the easiest way to check is to run tidyverse_update().\nThe easiest way to include data is to use dput() to generate the R code needed to recreate it. For example, to recreate the mtcars dataset in R, perform the following steps:\n\nRun dput(mtcars) in R\nCopy the output\nIn reprex, type mtcars &lt;-, then paste.\n\nTry to use the smallest subset of your data that still reveals the problem.\nSpend a little bit of time ensuring that your code is easy for others to read:\n\nMake sure you’ve used spaces and your variable names are concise yet informative.\nUse comments to indicate where your problem lies.\nDo your best to remove everything that is not related to the problem.\n\nThe shorter your code is, the easier it is to understand and the easier it is to fix.\n\nFinish by checking that you have actually made a reproducible example by starting a fresh R session and copying and pasting your script.\nCreating reprexes is not trivial, and it will take some practice to learn to create good, truly minimal reprexes. However, learning to ask questions that include the code, and investing the time to make it reproducible will continue to pay off as you learn and master R.",

    "text": "9.2 Aesthetic mappings\n\n“The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see.” — John Tukey\n\nRemember that the mpg data frame bundled with the ggplot2 package contains r nrow(mpg) observations on r mpg |&gt; distinct(model) |&gt; nrow() car models.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAmong the variables in mpg are:\n\ndispl: A car’s engine size, in liters. A numerical variable.\nhwy: A car’s fuel efficiency on the highway, in miles per gallon (mpg). A car with a low fuel efficiency consumes more fuel than a car with a high fuel efficiency when they travel the same distance. A numerical variable.\nclass: Type of car. A categorical variable.\n\nLet’s start by visualizing the relationship between displ and hwy for various classes of cars. We can do this with a scatterplot where the numerical variables are mapped to the x and y aesthetics and the categorical variable is mapped to an aesthetic like color or shape.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen class is mapped to shape, we get two warnings:\n\n1: The shape palette can deal with a maximum of 6 discrete values because more than 6 becomes difficult to discriminate; you have 7. Consider specifying shapes manually if you must have them.\n2: Removed 62 rows containing missing values (geom_point()).\n\nSince ggplot2 will only use six shapes at a time, by default, additional groups will go unplotted when you use the shape aesthetic. The second warning is related – there are 62 SUVs in the dataset and they’re not plotted.\nSimilarly, we can map class to size or alpha aesthetics as well, which control the size and the transparency of the points, respectively.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBoth of these produce warnings as well:\n\nUsing alpha for a discrete variable is not advised.\n\nMapping an unordered discrete (categorical) variable (class) to an ordered aesthetic (size or alpha) is generally not a good idea because it implies a ranking that does not in fact exist.\nOnce you map an aesthetic, ggplot2 takes care of the rest. It selects a reasonable scale to use with the aesthetic, and it constructs a legend that explains the mapping between levels and values. For x and y aesthetics, ggplot2 does not create a legend, but it creates an axis line with tick marks and a label. The axis line provides the same information as a legend; it explains the mapping between locations and values.\nYou can also set the visual properties of your geom manually as an argument of your geom function (outside of aes()) instead of relying on a variable mapping to determine the appearance. For example, we can make all of the points in our plot blue:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere, the color doesn’t convey information about a variable, but only changes the appearance of the plot. You’ll need to pick a value that makes sense for that aesthetic:\n\nThe name of a color as a character string, e.g., color = \"blue\"\nThe size of a point in mm, e.g., size = 1\nThe shape of a point as a number, e.g, shape = 1, as shown in ?fig-shapes.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSo far we have discussed aesthetics that we can map or set in a scatterplot, when using a point geom. You can learn more about all possible aesthetic mappings in the aesthetic specifications vignette at https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2-specs.html.\nThe specific aesthetics you can use for a plot depend on the geom you use to represent the data. In the next section we dive deeper into geoms.\n\n9.2.1 Exercises\n\nCreate a scatterplot of hwy vs. displ where the points are pink filled in triangles.\nWhy did the following code not result in a plot with blue points?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhat does the stroke aesthetic do? What shapes does it work with? (Hint: use ?geom_point)\nWhat happens if you map an aesthetic to something other than a variable name, like aes(color = displ &lt; 5)?

    "text": "9.3 Geometric objects\nHow are these two plots similar?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBoth plots contain the same x variable, the same y variable, and both describe the same data. But the plots are not identical. Each plot uses a different geometric object, geom, to represent the data. The plot on the left uses the point geom, and the plot on the right uses the smooth geom, a smooth line fitted to the data.\nTo change the geom in your plot, change the geom function that you add to ggplot(). For instance, to make the plots above, you can use the following code:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nEvery geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument, either defined locally in the geom layer or globally in the ggplot() layer. However, not every aesthetic works with every geom. You could set the shape of a point, but you couldn’t set the “shape” of a line. If you try, ggplot2 will silently ignore that aesthetic mapping. On the other hand, you could set the linetype of a line. geom_smooth() will draw a different line, with a different linetype, for each unique value of the variable that you map to linetype.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere, geom_smooth() separates the cars into three lines based on their drv value, which describes a car’s drive train. One line describes all of the points that have a 4 value, one line describes all of the points that have an f value, and one line describes all of the points that have an r value. Here, 4 stands for four-wheel drive, f for front-wheel drive, and r for rear-wheel drive.\nIf this sounds strange, we can make it clearer by overlaying the lines on top of the raw data and then coloring everything according to drv.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotice that this plot contains two geoms in the same graph.\nMany geoms, like geom_smooth(), use a single geometric object to display multiple rows of data. For these geoms, you can set the group aesthetic to a categorical variable to draw multiple objects. ggplot2 will draw a separate object for each unique value of the grouping variable. In practice, ggplot2 will automatically group the data for these geoms whenever you map an aesthetic to a discrete variable (as in the linetype example). It is convenient to rely on this feature because the group aesthetic by itself does not add a legend or distinguishing features to the geoms.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. This makes it possible to display different aesthetics in different layers.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can use the same idea to specify different data for each layer. Here, we use red points as well as open circles to highlight two-seater cars. The local data argument in geom_point() overrides the global data argument in ggplot() for that layer only.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nGeoms are the fundamental building blocks of ggplot2. You can completely transform the look of your plot by changing its geom, and different geoms can reveal different features of your data. For example, the histogram and density plot below reveal that the distribution of highway mileage is bimodal and right skewed while the boxplot reveals two potential outliers.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nggplot2 provides more than 40 geoms but these don’t cover all possible plots one could make. If you need a different geom, we recommend looking into extension packages first to see if someone else has already implemented it (see https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/ for a sampling). For example, the ggridges package (https://wilkelab.org/ggridges) is useful for making ridgeline plots, which can be useful for visualizing the density of a numerical variable for different levels of a categorical variable. In the following plot not only did we use a new geom (geom_density_ridges()), but we have also mapped the same variable to multiple aesthetics (drv to y, fill, and color) as well as set an aesthetic (alpha = 0.5) to make the density curves transparent.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe best place to get a comprehensive overview of all of the geoms ggplot2 offers, as well as all functions in the package, is the reference page: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference. To learn more about any single geom, use the help (e.g., ?geom_smooth).\n\n9.3.1 Exercises\n\nWhat geom would you use to draw a line chart? A boxplot? A histogram?

This is useful when you want to compare data across facets but it can be limiting when you want to visualize the relationship within each facet better.

    "text": "9.5 Statistical transformations\nConsider a basic bar chart, drawn with geom_bar() or geom_col(). The following chart displays the total number of diamonds in the diamonds dataset, grouped by cut. The diamonds dataset is in the ggplot2 package and contains information on ~54,000 diamonds, including the price, carat, color, clarity, and cut of each diamond. The chart shows that more diamonds are available with high quality cuts than with low quality cuts.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOn the x-axis, the chart displays cut, a variable from diamonds. On the y-axis, it displays count, but count is not a variable in diamonds! Where does count come from? Many graphs, like scatterplots, plot the raw values of your dataset. Other graphs, like bar charts, calculate new values to plot:\n\nBar charts, histograms, and frequency polygons bin your data and then plot bin counts, the number of points that fall in each bin.\nSmoothers fit a model to your data and then plot predictions from the model.\nBoxplots compute the five-number summary of the distribution and then display that summary as a specially formatted box.\n\nThe algorithm used to calculate new values for a graph is called a stat, short for statistical transformation. Figure 9.2 shows how this process works with geom_bar().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: When creating a bar chart we first start with the raw data, then aggregate it to count the number of observations in each bar, and finally map those computed variables to plot aesthetics.\n\n\n\n\nYou can learn which stat a geom uses by inspecting the default value for the stat argument. For example, ?geom_bar shows that the default value for stat is “count”, which means that geom_bar() uses stat_count(). stat_count() is documented on the same page as geom_bar(). If you scroll down, the section called “Computed variables” explains that it computes two new variables: count and prop.\nEvery geom has a default stat; and every stat has a default geom. This means that you can typically use geoms without worrying about the underlying statistical transformation. However, there are three reasons why you might need to use a stat explicitly:\n\nYou might want to override the default stat. In the code below, we change the stat of geom_bar() from count (the default) to identity. This lets us map the height of the bars to the raw values of a y variable.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou might want to override the default mapping from transformed variables to aesthetics. For example, you might want to display a bar chart of proportions, rather than counts:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo find the possible variables that can be computed by the stat, look for the section titled “computed variables” in the help for geom_bar().\nYou might want to draw greater attention to the statistical transformation in your code. For example, you might use stat_summary(), which summarizes the y values for each unique x value, to draw attention to the summary that you’re computing:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nggplot2 provides more than 20 stats for you to use. Each stat is a function, so you can get help in the usual way, e.g., ?stat_bin.\n\n9.5.1 Exercises\n\nWhat is the default geom associated with stat_summary()? How could you rewrite the previous plot to use that geom function instead of the stat function?\nWhat does geom_col() do?

You can color a bar chart using either the color aesthetic, or, more usefully, the fill aesthetic:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote what happens if you map the fill aesthetic to another variable, like class: the bars are automatically stacked. Each colored rectangle represents a combination of drv and class.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe stacking is performed automatically using the position adjustment specified by the position argument. If you don’t want a stacked bar chart, you can use one of three other options: \"identity\", \"dodge\" or \"fill\".\n\nposition = \"identity\" will place each object exactly where it falls in the context of the graph. This is not very useful for bars, because it overlaps them. To see that overlapping we either need to make the bars slightly transparent by setting alpha to a small value, or completely transparent by setting fill = NA.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe identity position adjustment is more useful for 2d geoms, like points, where it is the default.\nposition = \"fill\" works like stacking, but makes each set of stacked bars the same height. This makes it easier to compare proportions across groups.\nposition = \"dodge\" places overlapping objects directly beside one another. This makes it easier to compare individual values.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nThere’s one other type of adjustment that’s not useful for bar charts, but can be very useful for scatterplots. Recall our first scatterplot. Did you notice that the plot displays only 126 points, even though there are 234 observations in the dataset?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe underlying values of hwy and displ are rounded so the points appear on a grid and many points overlap each other. This problem is known as overplotting. This arrangement makes it difficult to see the distribution of the data. Are the data points spread equally throughout the graph, or is there one special combination of hwy and displ that contains 109 values?\nYou can avoid this gridding by setting the position adjustment to “jitter”. position = \"jitter\" adds a small amount of random noise to each point. This spreads the points out because no two points are likely to receive the same amount of random noise.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAdding randomness seems like a strange way to improve your plot, but while it makes your graph less accurate at small scales, it makes your graph more revealing at large scales. Because this is such a useful operation, ggplot2 comes with a shorthand for geom_point(position = \"jitter\"): geom_jitter().\nTo learn more about a position adjustment, look up the help page associated with each adjustment: ?position_dodge, ?position_fill, ?position_identity, ?position_jitter, and ?position_stack.\n\n9.6.1 Exercises\n\nWhat is the problem with the following plot?

In practice, you rarely need to supply all seven parameters to make a graph because ggplot2 will provide useful defaults for everything except the data, the mappings, and the geom function.\nThe seven parameters in the template compose the grammar of graphics, a formal system for building plots. The grammar of graphics is based on the insight that you can uniquely describe any plot as a combination of a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, a position adjustment, a coordinate system, a faceting scheme, and a theme.\nTo see how this works, consider how you could build a basic plot from scratch: you could start with a dataset and then transform it into the information that you want to display (with a stat). Next, you could choose a geometric object to represent each observation in the transformed data. You could then use the aesthetic properties of the geoms to represent variables in the data. You would map the values of each variable to the levels of an aesthetic. These steps are illustrated in ?fig-visualization-grammar. You’d then select a coordinate system to place the geoms into, using the location of the objects (which is itself an aesthetic property) to display the values of the x and y variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Steps for going from raw data to a table of frequencies to a bar plot where the heights of the bar represent the frequencies.\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, you would have a complete graph, but you could further adjust the positions of the geoms within the coordinate system (a position adjustment) or split the graph into subplots (faceting). You could also extend the plot by adding one or more additional layers, where each additional layer uses a dataset, a geom, a set of mappings, a stat, and a position adjustment.\nYou could use this method to build any plot that you imagine. In other words, you can use the code template that you’ve learned in this chapter to build hundreds of thousands of unique plots.\nIf you’d like to learn more about the theoretical underpinnings of ggplot2, you might enjoy reading “The Layered Grammar of Graphics”, the scientific paper that describes the theory of ggplot2 in detail.",

One layer we have not yet touched on is theme, which we will introduce in Section 11.5.\nTwo very useful resources for getting an overview of the complete ggplot2 functionality are the ggplot2 cheatsheet (which you can find at https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets) and the ggplot2 package website (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org).\nAn important lesson you should take from this chapter is that when you feel the need for a geom that is not provided by ggplot2, it’s always a good idea to look into whether someone else has already solved your problem by creating a ggplot2 extension package that offers that geom.",

During the initial phases of EDA you should feel free to investigate every idea that occurs to you. Some of these ideas will pan out, and some will be dead ends. As your exploration continues, you will home in on a few particularly productive insights that you’ll eventually write up and communicate to others.\nEDA is an important part of any data analysis, even if the primary research questions are handed to you on a platter, because you always need to investigate the quality of your data.

The easiest way to do this is to use questions as tools to guide your investigation. When you ask a question, the question focuses your attention on a specific part of your dataset and helps you decide which graphs, models, or transformations to make.\nEDA is fundamentally a creative process. And like most creative processes, the key to asking quality questions is to generate a large quantity of questions. It is difficult to ask revealing questions at the start of your analysis because you do not know what insights can be gleaned from your dataset. On the other hand, each new question that you ask will expose you to a new aspect of your data and increase your chance of making a discovery. You can quickly drill down into the most interesting parts of your data—and develop a set of thought-provoking questions—if you follow up each question with a new question based on what you find.\nThere is no rule about which questions you should ask to guide your research. However, two types of questions will always be useful for making discoveries within your data. You can loosely word these questions as:\n\nWhat type of variation occurs within my variables?\nWhat type of covariation occurs between my variables?\n\nThe rest of this chapter will look at these two questions. We’ll explain what variation and covariation are, and we’ll show you several ways to answer each question.",

    "section": "10.3 Variation",
    "text": "10.3 Variation\nVariation is the tendency of the values of a variable to change from measurement to measurement. You can see variation easily in real life; if you measure any continuous variable twice, you will get two different results. This is true even if you measure quantities that are constant, like the speed of light. Each of your measurements will include a small amount of error that varies from measurement to measurement. Variables can also vary if you measure across different subjects (e.g., the eye colors of different people) or at different times (e.g., the energy levels of an electron at different moments). Every variable has its own pattern of variation, which can reveal interesting information about how that it varies between measurements on the same observation as well as across observations. The best way to understand that pattern is to visualize the distribution of the variable’s values, which you’ve learned about in Chapter 1.\nWe’ll start our exploration by visualizing the distribution of weights (carat) of ~54,000 diamonds from the diamonds dataset. Since carat is a numerical variable, we can use a histogram:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow that you can visualize variation, what should you look for in your plots? And what type of follow-up questions should you ask? We’ve put together a list below of the most useful types of information that you will find in your graphs, along with some follow-up questions for each type of information. The key to asking good follow-up questions will be to rely on your curiosity (What do you want to learn more about?) as well as your skepticism (How could this be misleading?).\n\n10.3.1 Typical values\nIn both bar charts and histograms, tall bars show the common values of a variable, and shorter bars show less-common values. Places that do not have bars reveal values that were not seen in your data. To turn this information into useful questions, look for anything unexpected:\n\nWhich values are the most common? Why?\nWhich values are rare? Why? Does that match your expectations?\nCan you see any unusual patterns? What might explain them?\n\nLet’s take a look at the distribution of carat for smaller diamonds.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis histogram suggests several interesting questions:\n\nWhy are there more diamonds at whole carats and common fractions of carats?\nWhy are there more diamonds slightly to the right of each peak than there are slightly to the left of each peak?\n\nVisualizations can also reveal clusters, which suggest that subgroups exist in your data. To understand the subgroups, ask:\n\nHow are the observations within each subgroup similar to each other?\nHow are the observations in separate clusters different from each other?\nHow can you explain or describe the clusters?\nWhy might the appearance of clusters be misleading?\n\nSome of these questions can be answered with the data while some will require domain expertise about the data. Many of them will prompt you to explore a relationship between variables, for example, to see if the values of one variable can explain the behavior of another variable. We’ll get to that shortly.\n\n\n10.3.2 Unusual values\nOutliers are observations that are unusual; data points that don’t seem to fit the pattern. Sometimes outliers are data entry errors, sometimes they are simply values at the extremes that happened to be observed in this data collection, and other times they suggest important new discoveries. When you have a lot of data, outliers are sometimes difficult to see in a histogram. For example, take the distribution of the y variable from the diamonds dataset. The only evidence of outliers is the unusually wide limits on the x-axis.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere are so many observations in the common bins that the rare bins are very short, making it very difficult to see them (although maybe if you stare intently at 0 you’ll spot something). To make it easy to see the unusual values, we need to zoom to small values of the y-axis with coord_cartesian():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\ncoord_cartesian() also has an xlim() argument for when you need to zoom into the x-axis. ggplot2 also has xlim() and ylim() functions that work slightly differently: they throw away the data outside the limits.\nThis allows us to see that there are three unusual values: 0, ~30, and ~60. We pluck them out with dplyr:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe y variable measures one of the three dimensions of these diamonds, in mm. We know that diamonds can’t have a width of 0mm, so these values must be incorrect. By doing EDA, we have discovered missing data that was coded as 0, which we never would have found by simply searching for NAs. Going forward we might choose to re-code these values as NAs in order to prevent misleading calculations. We might also suspect that measurements of 32mm and 59mm are implausible: those diamonds are over an inch long, but don’t cost hundreds of thousands of dollars!\nIt’s good practice to repeat your analysis with and without the outliers. If they have minimal effect on the results, and you can’t figure out why they’re there, it’s reasonable to omit them, and move on. However, if they have a substantial effect on your results, you shouldn’t drop them without justification. You’ll need to figure out what caused them (e.g., a data entry error) and disclose that you removed them in your write-up.\n\n\n10.3.3 Exercises\n\nExplore the distribution of each of the x, y, and z variables in diamonds. What do you learn? Think about a diamond and how you might decide which dimension is the length, width, and depth.\nExplore the distribution of price. Do you discover anything unusual or surprising? (Hint: Carefully think about the binwidth and make sure you try a wide range of values.)\nHow many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat? What do you think is the cause of the difference?\nCompare and contrast coord_cartesian() vs. xlim() or ylim() when zooming in on a histogram. What happens if you leave binwidth unset? What happens if you try and zoom so only half a bar shows?",

Additionally, if you have low quality data, by the time that you’ve applied this approach to every variable you might find that you don’t have any data left!\nInstead, we recommend replacing the unusual values with missing values.

The best way to spot covariation is to visualize the relationship between two or more variables.\n\n10.5.1 A categorical and a numerical variable\nFor example, let’s explore how the price of a diamond varies with its quality (measured by cut) using geom_freqpoly():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that ggplot2 uses an ordered color scale for cut because it’s defined as an ordered factor variable in the data. You’ll learn more about these in Section 16.6.\nThe default appearance of geom_freqpoly() is not that useful here because the height, determined by the overall count, differs so much across cuts, making it hard to see the differences in the shapes of their distributions.\nTo make the comparison easier we need to swap what is displayed on the y-axis. Instead of displaying count, we’ll display the density, which is the count standardized so that the area under each frequency polygon is one.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that we’re mapping the density to y, but since density is not a variable in the diamonds dataset, we need to first calculate it. We use the after_stat() function to do so.\nThere’s something rather surprising about this plot - it appears that fair diamonds (the lowest quality) have the highest average price! But maybe that’s because frequency polygons are a little hard to interpret - there’s a lot going on in this plot.\nA visually simpler plot for exploring this relationship is using side-by-side boxplots.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe see much less information about the distribution, but the boxplots are much more compact so we can more easily compare them (and fit more on one plot). It supports the counter-intuitive finding that better quality diamonds are typically cheaper! In the exercises, you’ll be challenged to figure out why.\ncut is an ordered factor: fair is worse than good, which is worse than very good and so on. Many categorical variables don’t have such an intrinsic order, so you might want to reorder them to make a more informative display. One way to do that is with fct_reorder(). You’ll learn more about that function in Section 16.4, but we want to give you a quick preview here because it’s so useful. For example, take the class variable in the mpg dataset. You might be interested to know how highway mileage varies across classes:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo make the trend easier to see, we can reorder class based on the median value of hwy:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you have long variable names, geom_boxplot() will work better if you flip it 90°. You can do that by exchanging the x and y aesthetic mappings.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n10.5.1.1 Exercises\n\nUse what you’ve learned to improve the visualization of the departure times of cancelled vs. non-cancelled flights.\nBased on EDA, what variable in the diamonds dataset appears to be most important for predicting the price of a diamond? How is that variable correlated with cut? Why does the combination of those two relationships lead to lower quality diamonds being more expensive?\nInstead of exchanging the x and y variables, add coord_flip() as a new layer to the vertical boxplot to create a horizontal one. How does this compare to exchanging the variables?\nOne problem with boxplots is that they were developed in an era of much smaller datasets and tend to display a prohibitively large number of “outlying values”. One approach to remedy this problem is the letter value plot. Install the lvplot package, and try using geom_lv() to display the distribution of price vs. cut. What do you learn? How do you interpret the plots?\nCreate a visualization of diamond prices vs. a categorical variable from the diamonds dataset using geom_violin(), then a faceted geom_histogram(), then a colored geom_freqpoly(), and then a colored geom_density(). Compare and contrast the four plots. What are the pros and cons of each method of visualizing the distribution of a numerical variable based on the levels of a categorical variable?\nIf you have a small dataset, it’s sometimes useful to use geom_jitter() to avoid overplotting to more easily see the relationship between a continuous and categorical variable. The ggbeeswarm package provides a number of methods similar to geom_jitter(). List them and briefly describe what each one does.\n\n\n\n\n10.5.2 Two categorical variables\nTo visualize the covariation between categorical variables, you’ll need to count the number of observations for each combination of levels of these categorical variables. One way to do that is to rely on the built-in geom_count():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe size of each circle in the plot displays how many observations occurred at each combination of values. Covariation will appear as a strong correlation between specific x values and specific y values.\nAnother approach for exploring the relationship between these variables is computing the counts with dplyr:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThen visualize with geom_tile() and the fill aesthetic:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf the categorical variables are unordered, you might want to use the seriation package to simultaneously reorder the rows and columns in order to more clearly reveal interesting patterns. For larger plots, you might want to try the heatmaply package, which creates interactive plots.\n\n10.5.2.1 Exercises\n\nHow could you rescale the count dataset above to more clearly show the distribution of cut within color, or color within cut?\nWhat different data insights do you get with a segmented bar chart if color is mapped to the x aesthetic and cut is mapped to the fill aesthetic? Calculate the counts that fall into each of the segments.\nUse geom_tile() together with dplyr to explore how average flight departure delays vary by destination and month of year. What makes the plot difficult to read? How could you improve it?\n\n\n\n\n10.5.3 Two numerical variables\nYou’ve already seen one great way to visualize the covariation between two numerical variables: draw a scatterplot with geom_point(). You can see covariation as a pattern in the points. For example, you can see a positive relationship between the carat size and price of a diamond: diamonds with more carats have a higher price. The relationship is exponential.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n(In this section we’ll use the smaller dataset to stay focused on the bulk of the diamonds that are smaller than 3 carats)\nScatterplots become less useful as the size of your dataset grows, because points begin to overplot, and pile up into areas of uniform black, making it hard to judge differences in the density of the data across the 2-dimensional space as well as making it hard to spot the trend. You’ve already seen one way to fix the problem: using the alpha aesthetic to add transparency.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBut using transparency can be challenging for very large datasets. Another solution is to use bin. Previously you used geom_histogram() and geom_freqpoly() to bin in one dimension. Now you’ll learn how to use geom_bin2d() and geom_hex() to bin in two dimensions.\ngeom_bin2d() and geom_hex() divide the coordinate plane into 2d bins and then use a fill color to display how many points fall into each bin. geom_bin2d() creates rectangular bins. geom_hex() creates hexagonal bins. You will need to install the hexbin package to use geom_hex().\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnother option is to bin one continuous variable so it acts like a categorical variable. Then you can use one of the techniques for visualizing the combination of a categorical and a continuous variable that you learned about. For example, you could bin carat and then for each group, display a boxplot:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\ncut_width(x, width), as used above, divides x into bins of width width. By default, boxplots look roughly the same (apart from number of outliers) regardless of how many observations there are, so it’s difficult to tell that each boxplot summaries a different number of points. One way to show that is to make the width of the boxplot proportional to the number of points with varwidth = TRUE.\n\n10.5.3.1 Exercises\n\nInstead of summarizing the conditional distribution with a boxplot, you could use a frequency polygon. What do you need to consider when using cut_width() vs. cut_number()? How does that impact a visualization of the 2d distribution of carat and price?\nVisualize the distribution of carat, partitioned by price.\nHow does the price distribution of very large diamonds compare to small diamonds? Is it as you expect, or does it surprise you?\nCombine two of the techniques you’ve learned to visualize the combined distribution of cut, carat, and price.\nTwo dimensional plots reveal outliers that are not visible in one dimensional plots. For example, some points in the following plot have an unusual combination of x and y values, which makes the points outliers even though their x and y values appear normal when examined separately. Why is a scatterplot a better display than a binned plot for this case?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nInstead of creating boxes of equal width with cut_width(), we could create boxes that contain roughly equal number of points with cut_number(). What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "10.6 Patterns and models\nIf a systematic relationship exists between two variables it will appear as a pattern in the data. If you spot a pattern, ask yourself:\n\nCould this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?\nHow can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?\nHow strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?\nWhat other variables might affect the relationship?\nDoes the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?\n\nPatterns in your data provide clues about relationships, i.e., they reveal covariation. If you think of variation as a phenomenon that creates uncertainty, covariation is a phenomenon that reduces it. If two variables covary, you can use the values of one variable to make better predictions about the values of the second. If the covariation is due to a causal relationship (a special case), then you can use the value of one variable to control the value of the second.\nModels are a tool for extracting patterns out of data. For example, consider the diamonds data. It’s hard to understand the relationship between cut and price, because cut and carat, and carat and price are tightly related. It’s possible to use a model to remove the very strong relationship between price and carat so we can explore the subtleties that remain. The following code fits a model that predicts price from carat and then computes the residuals (the difference between the predicted value and the actual value). The residuals give us a view of the price of the diamond, once the effect of carat has been removed. Note that instead of using the raw values of price and carat, we log transform them first, and fit a model to the log-transformed values. Then, we exponentiate the residuals to put them back in the scale of raw prices.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOnce you’ve removed the strong relationship between carat and price, you can see what you expect in the relationship between cut and price: relative to their size, better quality diamonds are more expensive.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe’re not discussing modelling in this book because understanding what models are and how they work is easiest once you have tools of data wrangling and programming in hand.",

When you make exploratory plots, you know—even before looking—which variables the plot will display. You made each plot for a purpose, could quickly look at it, and then move on to the next plot. In the course of most analyses, you’ll produce tens or hundreds of plots, most of which are immediately thrown away.\nNow that you understand your data, you need to communicate your understanding to others. Your audience will likely not share your background knowledge and will not be deeply invested in the data. To help others quickly build up a good mental model of the data, you will need to invest considerable effort in making your plots as self-explanatory as possible. In this chapter, you’ll learn some of the tools that ggplot2 provides to do so.\nThis chapter focuses on the tools you need to create good graphics. We assume that you know what you want, and just need to know how to do it. For that reason, we highly recommend pairing this chapter with a good general visualization book. We particularly like The Truthful Art, by Albert Cairo. It doesn’t teach the mechanics of creating visualizations, but instead focuses on what you need to think about in order to create effective graphics.",

    "section": "\n11.3 Annotations",
    "text": "11.3 Annotations\nIn addition to labelling major components of your plot, it’s often useful to label individual observations or groups of observations. The first tool you have at your disposal is geom_text(). geom_text() is similar to geom_point(), but it has an additional aesthetic: label. This makes it possible to add textual labels to your plots.\nThere are two possible sources of labels. First, you might have a tibble that provides labels. In the following plot we pull out the cars with the highest engine size in each drive type and save their information as a new data frame called label_info.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThen, we use this new data frame to directly label the three groups to replace the legend with labels placed directly on the plot. Using the fontface and size arguments we can customize the look of the text labels. They’re larger than the rest of the text on the plot and bolded. (theme(legend.position = \"none\") turns all the legends off — we’ll talk about it more shortly.)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote the use of hjust (horizontal justification) and vjust (vertical justification) to control the alignment of the label.\nHowever the annotated plot we made above is hard to read because the labels overlap with each other, and with the points. We can use the geom_label_repel() function from the ggrepel package to address both of these issues. This useful package will automatically adjust labels so that they don’t overlap:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also use the same idea to highlight certain points on a plot with geom_text_repel() from the ggrepel package. Note another handy technique used here: we added a second layer of large, hollow points to further highlight the labelled points.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nRemember, in addition to geom_text() and geom_label(), you have many other geoms in ggplot2 available to help annotate your plot. A couple ideas:\n\nUse geom_hline() and geom_vline() to add reference lines. We often make them thick (linewidth = 2) and white (color = white), and draw them underneath the primary data layer. That makes them easy to see, without drawing attention away from the data.\nUse geom_rect() to draw a rectangle around points of interest. The boundaries of the rectangle are defined by aesthetics xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax. Alternatively, look into the ggforce package, specifically geom_mark_hull(), which allows you to annotate subsets of points with hulls.\nUse geom_segment() with the arrow argument to draw attention to a point with an arrow. Use aesthetics x and y to define the starting location, and xend and yend to define the end location.\n\nAnother handy function for adding annotations to plots is annotate(). As a rule of thumb, geoms are generally useful for highlighting a subset of the data while annotate() is useful for adding one or few annotation elements to a plot.\nTo demonstrate using annotate(), let’s create some text to add to our plot. The text is a bit long, so we’ll use stringr::str_wrap() to automatically add line breaks to it given the number of characters you want per line:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThen, we add two layers of annotation: one with a label geom and the other with a segment geom. The x and y aesthetics in both define where the annotation should start, and the xend and yend aesthetics in the segment annotation define the end location of the segment. Note also that the segment is styled as an arrow.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnnotation is a powerful tool for communicating main takeaways and interesting features of your visualizations. The only limit is your imagination (and your patience with positioning annotations to be aesthetically pleasing)!\n\n11.3.1 Exercises\n\nUse geom_text() with infinite positions to place text at the four corners of the plot.\nUse annotate() to add a point geom in the middle of your last plot without having to create a tibble. Customize the shape, size, or color of the point.\nHow do labels with geom_text() interact with faceting? How can you add a label to a single facet? How can you put a different label in each facet? (Hint: Think about the dataset that is being passed to geom_text().)\nWhat arguments to geom_label() control the appearance of the background box?\nWhat are the four arguments to arrow()? How do they work? Create a series of plots that demonstrate the most important options.",

    "href": "communication.html#scales",
    "title": "11  Communication",
    "section": "\n11.4 Scales",
    "text": "11.4 Scales\nThe third way you can make your plot better for communication is to adjust the scales. Scales control how the aesthetic mappings manifest visually.\n\n11.4.1 Default scales\nNormally, ggplot2 automatically adds scales for you. For example, when you type:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nggplot2 automatically adds default scales behind the scenes:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote the naming scheme for scales: scale_ followed by the name of the aesthetic, then _, then the name of the scale. The default scales are named according to the type of variable they align with: continuous, discrete, datetime, or date. scale_x_continuous() puts the numeric values from displ on a continuous number line on the x-axis, scale_color_discrete() chooses colors for each of the class of car, etc. There are lots of non-default scales which you’ll learn about below.\nThe default scales have been carefully chosen to do a good job for a wide range of inputs. Nevertheless, you might want to override the defaults for two reasons:\n\nYou might want to tweak some of the parameters of the default scale. This allows you to do things like change the breaks on the axes, or the key labels on the legend.\nYou might want to replace the scale altogether, and use a completely different algorithm. Often you can do better than the default because you know more about the data.\n\n11.4.2 Axis ticks and legend keys\nCollectively axes and legends are called guides. Axes are used for x and y aesthetics; legends are used for everything else.\nThere are two primary arguments that affect the appearance of the ticks on the axes and the keys on the legend: breaks and labels. Breaks controls the position of the ticks, or the values associated with the keys. Labels controls the text label associated with each tick/key. The most common use of breaks is to override the default choice:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can use labels in the same way (a character vector the same length as breaks), but you can also set it to NULL to suppress the labels altogether. This can be useful for maps, or for publishing plots where you can’t share the absolute numbers. You can also use breaks and labels to control the appearance of legends. For discrete scales for categorical variables, labels can be a named list of the existing level names and the desired labels for them.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe labels argument coupled with labelling functions from the scales package is also useful for formatting numbers as currency, percent, etc. The plot on the left shows default labelling with label_dollar(), which adds a dollar sign as well as a thousand separator comma. The plot on the right adds further customization by dividing dollar values by 1,000 and adding a suffix “K” (for “thousands”) as well as adding custom breaks. Note that breaks is in the original scale of the data.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnother handy label function is label_percent():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnother use of breaks is when you have relatively few data points and want to highlight exactly where the observations occur. For example, take this plot that shows when each US president started and ended their term.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that for the breaks argument we pulled out the start variable as a vector with presidential$start because we can’t do an aesthetic mapping for this argument. Also note that the specification of breaks and labels for date and datetime scales is a little different:\n\ndate_labels takes a format specification, in the same form as parse_datetime().\ndate_breaks (not shown here), takes a string like “2 days” or “1 month”.\n\n11.4.3 Legend layout\nYou will most often use breaks and labels to tweak the axes. While they both also work for legends, there are a few other techniques you are more likely to use.\nTo control the overall position of the legend, you need to use a theme() setting. We’ll come back to themes at the end of the chapter, but in brief, they control the non-data parts of the plot. The theme setting legend.position controls where the legend is drawn:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf your plot is short and wide, place the legend at the top or bottom, and if it’s tall and narrow, place the legend at the left or right. You can also use legend.position = \"none\" to suppress the display of the legend altogether.\nTo control the display of individual legends, use guides() along with guide_legend() or guide_colorbar(). The following example shows two important settings: controlling the number of rows the legend uses with nrow, and overriding one of the aesthetics to make the points bigger. This is particularly useful if you have used a low alpha to display many points on a plot.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that the name of the argument in guides() matches the name of the aesthetic, just like in labs().\n\n11.4.4 Replacing a scale\nInstead of just tweaking the details a little, you can instead replace the scale altogether. There are two types of scales you’re mostly likely to want to switch out: continuous position scales and color scales. Fortunately, the same principles apply to all the other aesthetics, so once you’ve mastered position and color, you’ll be able to quickly pick up other scale replacements.\nIt’s very useful to plot transformations of your variable. For example, it’s easier to see the precise relationship between carat and price if we log transform them:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHowever, the disadvantage of this transformation is that the axes are now labelled with the transformed values, making it hard to interpret the plot. Instead of doing the transformation in the aesthetic mapping, we can instead do it with the scale. This is visually identical, except the axes are labelled on the original data scale.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnother scale that is frequently customized is color. The default categorical scale picks colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. Useful alternatives are the ColorBrewer scales which have been hand tuned to work better for people with common types of color blindness. The two plots below look similar, but there is enough difference in the shades of red and green that the dots on the right can be distinguished even by people with red-green color blindness.1\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nDon’t forget simpler techniques for improving accessibility. If there are just a few colors, you can add a redundant shape mapping. This will also help ensure your plot is interpretable in black and white.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe ColorBrewer scales are documented online at https://colorbrewer2.org/ and made available in R via the RColorBrewer package, by Erich Neuwirth. ?fig-brewer shows the complete list of all palettes. The sequential (top) and diverging (bottom) palettes are particularly useful if your categorical values are ordered, or have a “middle”. This often arises if you’ve used cut() to make a continuous variable into a categorical variable.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen you have a predefined mapping between values and colors, use scale_color_manual(). For example, if we map presidential party to color, we want to use the standard mapping of red for Republicans and blue for Democrats. One approach for assigning these colors is using hex color codes:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFor continuous color, you can use the built-in scale_color_gradient() or scale_fill_gradient(). If you have a diverging scale, you can use scale_color_gradient2(). That allows you to give, for example, positive and negative values different colors. That’s sometimes also useful if you want to distinguish points above or below the mean.\nAnother option is to use the viridis color scales. The designers, Nathaniel Smith and Stéfan van der Walt, carefully tailored continuous color schemes that are perceptible to people with various forms of color blindness as well as perceptually uniform in both color and black and white. These scales are available as continuous (c), discrete (d), and binned (b) palettes in ggplot2.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that all color scales come in two varieties: scale_color_*() and scale_fill_*() for the color and fill aesthetics respectively (the color scales are available in both UK and US spellings).\n\n11.4.5 Zooming\nThere are three ways to control the plot limits:\n\nAdjusting what data are plotted.\nSetting the limits in each scale.\nSetting xlim and ylim in coord_cartesian().\n\nWe’ll demonstrate these options in a series of plots. The plot on the left shows the relationship between engine size and fuel efficiency, colored by type of drive train. The plot on the right shows the same variables, but subsets the data that are plotted. Subsetting the data has affected the x and y scales as well as the smooth curve.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nLet’s compare these to the two plots below where the plot on the left sets the limits on individual scales and the plot on the right sets them in coord_cartesian(). We can see that reducing the limits is equivalent to subsetting the data. Therefore, to zoom in on a region of the plot, it’s generally best to use coord_cartesian().\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOn the other hand, setting the limits on individual scales is generally more useful if you want to expand the limits, e.g., to match scales across different plots. For example, if we extract two classes of cars and plot them separately, it’s difficult to compare the plots because all three scales (the x-axis, the y-axis, and the color aesthetic) have different ranges.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOne way to overcome this problem is to share scales across multiple plots, training the scales with the limits of the full data.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this particular case, you could have simply used faceting, but this technique is useful more generally, if for instance, you want to spread plots over multiple pages of a report.\n\n11.4.6 Exercises\n\n\nWhy doesn’t the following code override the default scale?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhat is the first argument to every scale?

For example, in the plot below we change the direction of the legend as well as put a black border around it. Note that customization of the legend box and plot title elements of the theme are done with element_*() functions. These functions specify the styling of non-data components, e.g., the title text is bolded in the face argument of element_text() and the legend border color is defined in the color argument of element_rect(). The theme elements that control the position of the title and the caption are plot.title.position and plot.caption.position, respectively.

For example, df |&gt; filter(!is.na(x)) finds all rows where x is not missing and df |&gt; filter(x &lt; -10 | x &gt; 0) finds all rows where x is smaller than -10 or bigger than 0. Figure 12.1 shows the complete set of Boolean operations and how they work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: The complete set of Boolean operations. x is the left-hand circle, y is the right-hand circle, and the shaded regions show which parts each operator selects.\n\n\n\n\nAs well as & and |, R also has && and ||. Don’t use them in dplyr functions! These are called short-circuiting operators and only ever return a single TRUE or FALSE. They’re important for programming, not data science.\n\n12.3.1 Missing values\nThe rules for missing values in Boolean algebra are a little tricky to explain because they seem inconsistent at first glance:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo understand what’s going on, think about NA | TRUE (NA or TRUE). A missing value in a logical vector means that the value could either be TRUE or FALSE. TRUE | TRUE and FALSE | TRUE are both TRUE because at least one of them is TRUE. NA | TRUE must also be TRUE because NA can either be TRUE or FALSE. However, NA | FALSE is NA because we don’t know if NA is TRUE or FALSE. Similar reasoning applies with NA & FALSE.\n\n12.3.2 Order of operations\nNote that the order of operations doesn’t work like English.

What’s going on? Here, R first evaluates month == 11 creating a logical vector, which we call nov. It computes nov | 12.

    "text": "12.4 Summaries\nThe following sections describe some useful techniques for summarizing logical vectors. As well as functions that only work specifically with logical vectors, you can also use functions that work with numeric vectors.\n\n12.4.1 Logical summaries\nThere are two main logical summaries: any() and all(). any(x) is the equivalent of |; it’ll return TRUE if there are any TRUE’s in x. all(x) is equivalent of &; it’ll return TRUE only if all values of x are TRUE’s. Like all summary functions, they’ll return NA if there are any missing values present, and as usual you can make the missing values go away with na.rm = TRUE.\nFor example, we could use all() and any() to find out if every flight was delayed on departure by at most an hour or if any flights were delayed on arrival by five hours or more. And using group_by() allows us to do that by day:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn most cases, however, any() and all() are a little too crude, and it would be nice to be able to get a little more detail about how many values are TRUE or FALSE. That leads us to the numeric summaries.\n\n12.4.2 Numeric summaries of logical vectors\nWhen you use a logical vector in a numeric context, TRUE becomes 1 and FALSE becomes 0. This makes sum() and mean() very useful with logical vectors because sum(x) gives the number of TRUEs and mean(x) gives the proportion of TRUEs (because mean() is just sum() divided by length()).\nThat, for example, allows us to see the proportion of flights that were delayed on departure by at most an hour and the number of flights that were delayed on arrival by five hours or more:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n12.4.3 Logical subsetting\nThere’s one final use for logical vectors in summaries: you can use a logical vector to filter a single variable to a subset of interest. This makes use of the base [ (pronounced subset) operator, which you’ll learn more about in Section 27.2.\nImagine we wanted to look at the average delay just for flights that were actually delayed. One way to do so would be to first filter the flights and then calculate the average delay:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis works, but what if we wanted to also compute the average delay for flights that arrived early? We’d need to perform a separate filter step, and then figure out how to combine the two data frames together3. Instead you could use [ to perform an inline filtering: arr_delay[arr_delay &gt; 0] will yield only the positive arrival delays.\nThis leads to:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAlso note the difference in the group size: in the first chunk n() gives the number of delayed flights per day; in the second, n() gives the total number of flights.\n\n12.4.4 Exercises\n\nWhat will sum(is.na(x)) tell you? How about mean(is.na(x))?\nWhat does prod() return when applied to a logical vector? What logical summary function is it equivalent to? What does min() return when applied to a logical vector?

    "text": "12.5 Conditional transformations\nOne of the most powerful features of logical vectors are their use for conditional transformations, i.e. doing one thing for condition x, and something different for condition y. There are two important tools for this: if_else() and case_when().\n\n12.5.1 if_else()\n\nIf you want to use one value when a condition is TRUE and another value when it’s FALSE, you can use dplyr::if_else()4. You’ll always use the first three argument of if_else(). The first argument, condition, is a logical vector, the second, true, gives the output when the condition is true, and the third, false, gives the output if the condition is false.\nLet’s begin with a simple example of labeling a numeric vector as either “+ve” (positive) or “-ve” (negative):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere’s an optional fourth argument, missing which will be used if the input is NA:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also use vectors for the the true and false arguments. For example, this allows us to create a minimal implementation of abs():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSo far all the arguments have used the same vectors, but you can of course mix and match. For example, you could implement a simple version of coalesce() like this:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou might have noticed a small infelicity in our labeling example above: zero is neither positive nor negative. We could resolve this by adding an additional if_else():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis is already a little hard to read, and you can imagine it would only get harder if you have more conditions. Instead, you can switch to dplyr::case_when().\n\n12.5.2 case_when()\n\ndplyr’s case_when() is inspired by SQL’s CASE statement and provides a flexible way of performing different computations for different conditions. It has a special syntax that unfortunately looks like nothing else you’ll use in the tidyverse. It takes pairs that look like condition ~ output. condition must be a logical vector; when it’s TRUE, output will be used.\nThis means we could recreate our previous nested if_else() as follows:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis is more code, but it’s also more explicit.\nTo explain how case_when() works, let’s explore some simpler cases. If none of the cases match, the output gets an NA:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUse .default if you want to create a “default”/catch all value:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnd note that if multiple conditions match, only the first will be used:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nJust like with if_else() you can use variables on both sides of the ~ and you can mix and match variables as needed for your problem. For example, we could use case_when() to provide some human readable labels for the arrival delay:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBe wary when writing this sort of complex case_when() statement; my first two attempts used a mix of &lt; and &gt; and I kept accidentally creating overlapping conditions.\n\n12.5.3 Compatible types\nNote that both if_else() and case_when() require compatible types in the output. If they’re not compatible, you’ll see errors like this:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOverall, relatively few types are compatible, because automatically converting one type of vector to another is a common source of errors. Here are the most important cases that are compatible:\n\nNumeric and logical vectors are compatible, as we discussed in Section 12.4.2.\nStrings and factors (Chapter 16) are compatible, because you can think of a factor as a string with a restricted set of values.\nDates and date-times, which we’ll discuss in Chapter 17, are compatible because you can think of a date as a special case of date-time.\n\nNA, which is technically a logical vector, is compatible with everything because every vector has some way of representing a missing value.\n\nWe don’t expect you to memorize these rules, but they should become second nature over time because they are applied consistently throughout the tidyverse.\n\n12.5.4 Exercises\n\nA number is even if it’s divisible by two, which in R you can find out with x %% 2 == 0. Use this fact and if_else() to determine whether each number between 0 and 20 is even or odd.\nGiven a vector of days like x &lt;- c(\"Monday\", \"Saturday\", \"Wednesday\"), use an if_else() statement to label them as weekends or weekdays.\nUse if_else() to compute the absolute value of a numeric vector called x.\nWrite a case_when() statement that uses the month and day columns from flights to label a selection of important US holidays (e.g., New Years Day, 4th of July, Thanksgiving, and Christmas). First create a logical column that is either TRUE or FALSE, and then create a character column that either gives the name of the holiday or is NA.",

    "section": "13.4 Numeric transformations",
    "text": "13.4 Numeric transformations\nTransformation functions work well with mutate() because their output is the same length as the input. The vast majority of transformation functions are already built into base R. It’s impractical to list them all so this section will show the most useful ones. As an example, while R provides all the trigonometric functions that you might dream of, we don’t list them here because they’re rarely needed for data science.\n\n13.4.1 Arithmetic and recycling rules\nWe introduced the basics of arithmetic (+, -, *, /, ^) in Chapter 2 and have used them a bunch since. These functions don’t need a huge amount of explanation because they do what you learned in grade school. But we need to briefly talk about the recycling rules which determine what happens when the left and right hand sides have different lengths. This is important for operations like flights |&gt; mutate(air_time = air_time / 60) because there are 336,776 numbers on the left of / but only one on the right.\nR handles mismatched lengths by recycling, or repeating, the short vector. We can see this in operation more easily if we create some vectors outside of a data frame:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nGenerally, you only want to recycle single numbers (i.e. vectors of length 1), but R will recycle any shorter length vector. It usually (but not always) gives you a warning if the longer vector isn’t a multiple of the shorter:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThese recycling rules are also applied to logical comparisons (==, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, !=) and can lead to a surprising result if you accidentally use == instead of %in% and the data frame has an unfortunate number of rows. For example, take this code which attempts to find all flights in January and February:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe code runs without error, but it doesn’t return what you want. Because of the recycling rules it finds flights in odd numbered rows that departed in January and flights in even numbered rows that departed in February. And unfortunately there’s no warning because flights has an even number of rows.\nTo protect you from this type of silent failure, most tidyverse functions use a stricter form of recycling that only recycles single values. Unfortunately that doesn’t help here, or in many other cases, because the key computation is performed by the base R function ==, not filter().\n\n\n13.4.2 Minimum and maximum\nThe arithmetic functions work with pairs of variables. Two closely related functions are pmin() and pmax(), which when given two or more variables will return the smallest or largest value in each row:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that these are different to the summary functions min() and max() which take multiple observations and return a single value. You can tell that you’ve used the wrong form when all the minimums and all the maximums have the same value:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n13.4.3 Modular arithmetic\nModular arithmetic is the technical name for the type of math you did before you learned about decimal places, i.e. division that yields a whole number and a remainder. In R, %/% does integer division and %% computes the remainder:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nModular arithmetic is handy for the flights dataset, because we can use it to unpack the sched_dep_time variable into hour and minute:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can combine that with the mean(is.na(x)) trick from Section 12.4 to see how the proportion of cancelled flights varies over the course of the day. The results are shown in ?fig-prop-cancelled.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n13.4.4 Logarithms\nLogarithms are an incredibly useful transformation for dealing with data that ranges across multiple orders of magnitude and converting exponential growth to linear growth. In R, you have a choice of three logarithms: log() (the natural log, base e), log2() (base 2), and log10() (base 10). We recommend using log2() or log10(). log2() is easy to interpret because a difference of 1 on the log scale corresponds to doubling on the original scale and a difference of -1 corresponds to halving; whereas log10() is easy to back-transform because (e.g.) 3 is 10^3 = 1000. The inverse of log() is exp(); to compute the inverse of log2() or log10() you’ll need to use 2^ or 10^.\n\n\n13.4.5 Rounding\nUse round(x) to round a number to the nearest integer:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can control the precision of the rounding with the second argument, digits. round(x, digits) rounds to the nearest 10^-n so digits = 2 will round to the nearest 0.01. This definition is useful because it implies round(x, -3) will round to the nearest thousand, which indeed it does:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere’s one weirdness with round() that seems surprising at first glance:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nround() uses what’s known as “round half to even” or Banker’s rounding: if a number is half way between two integers, it will be rounded to the even integer. This is a good strategy because it keeps the rounding unbiased: half of all 0.5s are rounded up, and half are rounded down.\nround() is paired with floor() which always rounds down and ceiling() which always rounds up:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThese functions don’t have a digits argument, so you can instead scale down, round, and then scale back up:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can use the same technique if you want to round() to a multiple of some other number:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n13.4.6 Cutting numbers into ranges\nUse cut()1 to break up (aka bin) a numeric vector into discrete buckets:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe breaks don’t need to be evenly spaced:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can optionally supply your own labels. Note that there should be one less labels than breaks.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAny values outside of the range of the breaks will become NA:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSee the documentation for other useful arguments like right and include.lowest, which control if the intervals are [a, b) or (a, b] and if the lowest interval should be [a, b].\n\n\n13.4.7 Cumulative and rolling aggregates\nBase R provides cumsum(), cumprod(), cummin(), cummax() for running, or cumulative, sums, products, mins and maxes. dplyr provides cummean() for cumulative means. Cumulative sums tend to come up the most in practice:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you need more complex rolling or sliding aggregates, try the slider package.\n\n\n13.4.8 Exercises\n\nExplain in words what each line of the code used to generate ?fig-prop-cancelled does.\nWhat trigonometric functions does R provide? Guess some names and look up the documentation. Do they use degrees or radians?\nCurrently dep_time and sched_dep_time are convenient to look at, but hard to compute with because they’re not really continuous numbers. You can see the basic problem by running the code below: there’s a gap between each hour.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nConvert them to a more truthful representation of time (either fractional hours or minutes since midnight).\nRound dep_time and arr_time to the nearest five minutes.",

It uses the typical method for dealing with ties, e.g., 1st, 2nd, 2nd, 4th.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that the smallest values get the lowest ranks; use desc(x) to give the largest values the smallest ranks:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf min_rank() doesn’t do what you need, look at the variants dplyr::row_number(), dplyr::dense_rank(), dplyr::percent_rank(), and dplyr::cume_dist().

When combined with %% or %/% this can be a useful tool for dividing data into similarly sized groups:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n13.5.2 Offsets\ndplyr::lead() and dplyr::lag() allow you to refer the values just before or just after the “current” value. They return a vector of the same length as the input, padded with NAs at the start or end:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nx - lag(x) gives you the difference between the current and previous value.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nx == lag(x) tells you when the current value changes.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nYou can lead or lag by more than one position by using the second argument, n.\n\n\n13.5.3 Consecutive identifiers\nSometimes you want to start a new group every time some event occurs. For example, when you’re looking at website data, it’s common to want to break up events into sessions, where you begin a new session after gap of more than x minutes since the last activity. For example, imagine you have the times when someone visited a website:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnd you’ve computed the time between each event, and figured out if there’s a gap that’s big enough to qualify:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBut how do we go from that logical vector to something that we can group_by()? cumsum(), from Section 13.4.7, comes to the rescue as gap, i.e. has_gap is TRUE, will increment group by one (Section 12.4.2):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnother approach for creating grouping variables is consecutive_id(), which starts a new group every time one of its arguments changes. For example, inspired by this stackoverflow question, imagine you have a data frame with a bunch of repeated values:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you want to keep the first row from each repeated x, you could use group_by(), consecutive_id(), and slice_head():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n13.5.4 Exercises\n\nFind the 10 most delayed flights using a ranking function. How do you want to handle ties? Carefully read the documentation for min_rank().\nWhich plane (tailnum) has the worst on-time record?\nWhat time of day should you fly if you want to avoid delays as much as possible?\nWhat does flights |&gt; group_by(dest) |&gt; filter(row_number() &lt; 4) do? What does flights |&gt; group_by(dest) |&gt; filter(row_number(dep_delay) &lt; 4) do?\nFor each destination, compute the total minutes of delay. For each flight, compute the proportion of the total delay for its destination.\nDelays are typically temporally correlated: even once the problem that caused the initial delay has been resolved, later flights are delayed to allow earlier flights to leave. Using lag(), explore how the average flight delay for an hour is related to the average delay for the previous hour.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nLook at each destination.

    "section": "13.6 Numeric summaries",
    "text": "13.6 Numeric summaries\nJust using the counts, means, and sums that we’ve introduced already can get you a long way, but R provides many other useful summary functions. Here is a selection that you might find useful.\n\n13.6.1 Center\nSo far, we’ve mostly used mean() to summarize the center of a vector of values. As we’ve seen in Section 3.6, because the mean is the sum divided by the count, it is sensitive to even just a few unusually high or low values. An alternative is to use the median(), which finds a value that lies in the “middle” of the vector, i.e. 50% of the values is above it and 50% are below it. Depending on the shape of the distribution of the variable you’re interested in, mean or median might be a better measure of center. For example, for symmetric distributions we generally report the mean while for skewed distributions we usually report the median.\n?fig-mean-vs-median compares the mean vs. the median departure delay (in minutes) for each destination. The median delay is always smaller than the mean delay because flights sometimes leave multiple hours late, but never leave multiple hours early.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou might also wonder about the mode, or the most common value. This is a summary that only works well for very simple cases (which is why you might have learned about it in high school), but it doesn’t work well for many real datasets. If the data is discrete, there may be multiple most common values, and if the data is continuous, there might be no most common value because every value is ever so slightly different. For these reasons, the mode tends not to be used by statisticians and there’s no mode function included in base R2.\n\n\n13.6.2 Minimum, maximum, and quantiles\nWhat if you’re interested in locations other than the center? min() and max() will give you the largest and smallest values. Another powerful tool is quantile() which is a generalization of the median: quantile(x, 0.25) will find the value of x that is greater than 25% of the values, quantile(x, 0.5) is equivalent to the median, and quantile(x, 0.95) will find the value that’s greater than 95% of the values.\nFor the flights data, you might want to look at the 95% quantile of delays rather than the maximum, because it will ignore the 5% of most delayed flights which can be quite extreme.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n13.6.3 Spread\nSometimes you’re not so interested in where the bulk of the data lies, but in how it is spread out. Two commonly used summaries are the standard deviation, sd(x), and the inter-quartile range, IQR(). We won’t explain sd() here since you’re probably already familiar with it, but IQR() might be new — it’s quantile(x, 0.75) - quantile(x, 0.25) and gives you the range that contains the middle 50% of the data.\nWe can use this to reveal a small oddity in the flights data. You might expect the spread of the distance between origin and destination to be zero, since airports are always in the same place. But the code below reveals a data oddity for airport EGE:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n13.6.4 Distributions\nIt’s worth remembering that all of the summary statistics described above are a way of reducing the distribution down to a single number. This means that they’re fundamentally reductive, and if you pick the wrong summary, you can easily miss important differences between groups. That’s why it’s always a good idea to visualize the distribution before committing to your summary statistics.\n?fig-flights-dist shows the overall distribution of departure delays. The distribution is so skewed that we have to zoom in to see the bulk of the data. This suggests that the mean is unlikely to be a good summary and we might prefer the median instead.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s also a good idea to check that distributions for subgroups resemble the whole. In the following plot 365 frequency polygons of dep_delay, one for each day, are overlaid. The distributions seem to follow a common pattern, suggesting it’s fine to use the same summary for each day.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nDon’t be afraid to explore your own custom summaries specifically tailored for the data that you’re working with. In this case, that might mean separately summarizing the flights that left early vs. the flights that left late, or given that the values are so heavily skewed, you might try a log-transformation. Finally, don’t forget what you learned in Section 3.6: whenever creating numerical summaries, it’s a good idea to include the number of observations in each group.\n\n\n13.6.5 Positions\nThere’s one final type of summary that’s useful for numeric vectors, but also works with every other type of value: extracting a value at a specific position: first(x), last(x), and nth(x, n).\nFor example, we can find the first, fifth and last departure for each day:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n(NB: Because dplyr functions use _ to separate components of function and arguments names, these functions use na_rm instead of na.rm.)\nIf you’re familiar with [, which we’ll come back to in Section 27.2, you might wonder if you ever need these functions. There are three reasons: the default argument allows you to provide a default if the specified position doesn’t exist, the order_by argument allows you to locally override the order of the rows, and the na_rm argument allows you to drop missing values.\nExtracting values at positions is complementary to filtering on ranks. Filtering gives you all variables, with each observation in a separate row:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n13.6.6 With mutate()\nAs the names suggest, the summary functions are typically paired with summarize(). However, because of the recycling rules we discussed in Section 13.4.1 they can also be usefully paired with mutate(), particularly when you want do some sort of group standardization. For example:\n\nx / sum(x) calculates the proportion of a total.\n(x - mean(x)) / sd(x) computes a Z-score (standardized to mean 0 and sd 1).\n(x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)) standardizes to range [0, 1].\nx / first(x) computes an index based on the first observation.\n\n\n\n13.6.7 Exercises\n\nBrainstorm at least 5 different ways to assess the typical delay characteristics of a group of flights. When is mean() useful? When is median() useful? When might you want to use something else? Should you use arrival delay or departure delay? Why might you want to use data from planes?\nWhich destinations show the greatest variation in air speed?\nCreate a plot to further explore the adventures of EGE. Can you find any evidence that the airport moved locations? Can you find another variable that might explain the difference?",

Firstly, you can create a string using either single quotes (') or double quotes (\"). There’s no difference in behavior between the two, so in the interests of consistency, the tidyverse style guide recommends using \", unless the string contains multiple \".\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you forget to close a quote, you’ll see +, the continuation prompt:\n&gt; \"This is a string without a closing quote\n+ \n+ \n+ HELP I'M STUCK IN A STRING\nIf this happens to you and you can’t figure out which quote to close, press Escape to cancel and try again.\n\n14.2.1 Escapes\nTo include a literal single or double quote in a string, you can use \\ to “escape” it:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSo if you want to include a literal backslash in your string, you’ll need to escape it: \"\\\\\":\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBeware that the printed representation of a string is not the same as the string itself because the printed representation shows the escapes (in other words, when you print a string, you can copy and paste the output to recreate that string). To see the raw contents of the string, use str_view()1:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n14.2.2 Raw strings\nCreating a string with multiple quotes or backslashes gets confusing quickly. To illustrate the problem, let’s create a string that contains the contents of the code block where we define the double_quote and single_quote variables:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThat’s a lot of backslashes! (This is sometimes called leaning toothpick syndrome.) To eliminate the escaping, you can instead use a raw string2:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nA raw string usually starts with r\"( and finishes with )\". But if your string contains )\" you can instead use r\"[]\" or r\"{}\", and if that’s still not enough, you can insert any number of dashes to make the opening and closing pairs unique, e.g., r\"--()--\", r\"---()---\", etc. Raw strings are flexible enough to handle any text.\n\n14.2.3 Other special characters\nAs well as \\\", \\', and \\\\, there are a handful of other special characters that may come in handy. The most common are \\n, a new line, and \\t, tab. You’ll also sometimes see strings containing Unicode escapes that start with \\u or \\U. This is a way of writing non-English characters that work on all systems. You can see the complete list of other special characters in ?Quotes.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that str_view() uses curly braces for tabs to make them easier to spot3. One of the challenges of working with text is that there’s a variety of ways that white space can end up in the text, so this background helps you recognize that something strange is going on.\n\n14.2.4 Exercises\n\n\nCreate strings that contain the following values:\n\nHe said \"That's amazing!\"\n\\a\\b\\c\\d\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\n\n\nCreate the string in your R session and print it.

    "text": "14.3 Creating many strings from data\nNow that you’ve learned the basics of creating a string or two by “hand”, we’ll go into the details of creating strings from other strings. This will help you solve the common problem where you have some text you wrote that you want to combine with strings from a data frame. For example, you might combine “Hello” with a name variable to create a greeting. We’ll show you how to do this with str_c() and str_glue() and how you can use them with mutate(). That naturally raises the question of what stringr functions you might use with summarize(), so we’ll finish this section with a discussion of str_flatten(), which is a summary function for strings.\n\n14.3.1 str_c()\n\nstr_c() takes any number of vectors as arguments and returns a character vector:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nstr_c() is very similar to the base paste0(), but is designed to be used with mutate() by obeying the usual tidyverse rules for recycling and propagating missing values:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you want missing values to display in another way, use coalesce() to replace them. Depending on what you want, you might use it either inside or outside of str_c():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n14.3.2 str_glue()\n\nIf you are mixing many fixed and variable strings with str_c(), you’ll notice that you type a lot of \"s, making it hard to see the overall goal of the code. An alternative approach is provided by the glue package via str_glue()4. You give it a single string that has a special feature: anything inside {} will be evaluated like it’s outside of the quotes:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAs you can see, str_glue() currently converts missing values to the string \"NA\", unfortunately making it inconsistent with str_c().\nYou also might wonder what happens if you need to include a regular { or } in your string. You’re on the right track if you guess you’ll need to escape it somehow. The trick is that glue uses a slightly different escaping technique: instead of prefixing with special character like \\, you double up the special characters:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n14.3.3 str_flatten()\n\nstr_c() and str_glue() work well with mutate() because their output is the same length as their inputs. What if you want a function that works well with summarize(), i.e. something that always returns a single string? That’s the job of str_flatten()5: it takes a character vector and combines each element of the vector into a single string:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis makes it work well with summarize():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n14.3.4 Exercises\n\n\nCompare and contrast the results of paste0() with str_c() for the following inputs:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhat’s the difference between paste() and paste0()?

    "text": "14.4 Extracting data from strings\nIt’s very common for multiple variables to be crammed together into a single string. In this section, you’ll learn how to use four tidyr functions to extract them:\n\ndf |&gt; separate_longer_delim(col, delim)\ndf |&gt; separate_longer_position(col, width)\ndf |&gt; separate_wider_delim(col, delim, names)\ndf |&gt; separate_wider_position(col, widths)\n\nIf you look closely, you can see there’s a common pattern here: separate_, then longer or wider, then _, then by delim or position. That’s because these four functions are composed of two simpler primitives:\n\nJust like with pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(), _longer functions make the input data frame longer by creating new rows and _wider functions make the input data frame wider by generating new columns.\n\ndelim splits up a string with a delimiter like \", \" or \" \"; position splits at specified widths, like c(3, 5, 2).\n\nWe’ll return to the last member of this family, separate_wider_regex(), in Chapter 15. It’s the most flexible of the wider functions, but you need to know something about regular expressions before you can use it.\nThe following two sections will give you the basic idea behind these separate functions, first separating into rows (which is a little simpler) and then separating into columns. We’ll finish off by discussing the tools that the wider functions give you to diagnose problems.\n\n14.4.1 Separating into rows\nSeparating a string into rows tends to be most useful when the number of components varies from row to row. The most common case is requiring separate_longer_delim() to split based on a delimiter:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s rarer to see separate_longer_position() in the wild, but some older datasets do use a very compact format where each character is used to record a value:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n14.4.2 Separating into columns\nSeparating a string into columns tends to be most useful when there are a fixed number of components in each string, and you want to spread them into columns. They are slightly more complicated than their longer equivalents because you need to name the columns. For example, in this following dataset, x is made up of a code, an edition number, and a year, separated by \".\". To use separate_wider_delim(), we supply the delimiter and the names in two arguments:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf a specific piece is not useful you can use an NA name to omit it from the results:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nseparate_wider_position() works a little differently because you typically want to specify the width of each column. So you give it a named integer vector, where the name gives the name of the new column, and the value is the number of characters it occupies. You can omit values from the output by not naming them:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n14.4.3 Diagnosing widening problems\nseparate_wider_delim()6 requires a fixed and known set of columns. What happens if some of the rows don’t have the expected number of pieces? There are two possible problems, too few or too many pieces, so separate_wider_delim() provides two arguments to help: too_few and too_many. Let’s first look at the too_few case with the following sample dataset:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou’ll notice that we get an error, but the error gives us some suggestions on how you might proceed. Let’s start by debugging the problem:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen you use the debug mode, you get three extra columns added to the output: x_ok, x_pieces, and x_remainder (if you separate a variable with a different name, you’ll get a different prefix). Here, x_ok lets you quickly find the inputs that failed:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nx_pieces tells us how many pieces were found, compared to the expected 3 (the length of names). x_remainder isn’t useful when there are too few pieces, but we’ll see it again shortly.\nSometimes looking at this debugging information will reveal a problem with your delimiter strategy or suggest that you need to do more preprocessing before separating. In that case, fix the problem upstream and make sure to remove too_few = \"debug\" to ensure that new problems become errors.\nIn other cases, you may want to fill in the missing pieces with NAs and move on. That’s the job of too_few = \"align_start\" and too_few = \"align_end\" which allow you to control where the NAs should go:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe same principles apply if you have too many pieces:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBut now, when we debug the result, you can see the purpose of x_remainder:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou have a slightly different set of options for handling too many pieces: you can either silently “drop” any additional pieces or “merge” them all into the final column:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "section": "\n14.6 Non-English text",
    "text": "14.6 Non-English text\nSo far, we’ve focused on English language text which is particularly easy to work with for two reasons. Firstly, the English alphabet is relatively simple: there are just 26 letters. Secondly (and maybe more importantly), the computing infrastructure we use today was predominantly designed by English speakers. Unfortunately, we don’t have room for a full treatment of non-English languages. Still, we wanted to draw your attention to some of the biggest challenges you might encounter: encoding, letter variations, and locale-dependent functions.\n\n14.6.1 Encoding\nWhen working with non-English text, the first challenge is often the encoding. To understand what’s going on, we need to dive into how computers represent strings. In R, we can get at the underlying representation of a string using charToRaw():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nEach of these six hexadecimal numbers represents one letter: 48 is H, 61 is a, and so on. The mapping from hexadecimal number to character is called the encoding, and in this case, the encoding is called ASCII. ASCII does a great job of representing English characters because it’s the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.\nThings aren’t so easy for languages other than English. In the early days of computing, there were many competing standards for encoding non-English characters. For example, there were two different encodings for Europe: Latin1 (aka ISO-8859-1) was used for Western European languages, and Latin2 (aka ISO-8859-2) was used for Central European languages. In Latin1, the byte b1 is “±”, but in Latin2, it’s “ą”! Fortunately, today there is one standard that is supported almost everywhere: UTF-8. UTF-8 can encode just about every character used by humans today and many extra symbols like emojis.\nreadr uses UTF-8 everywhere. This is a good default but will fail for data produced by older systems that don’t use UTF-8. If this happens, your strings will look weird when you print them. Sometimes just one or two characters might be messed up; other times, you’ll get complete gibberish. For example here are two inline CSVs with unusual encodings8:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo read these correctly, you specify the encoding via the locale argument:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHow do you find the correct encoding? If you’re lucky, it’ll be included somewhere in the data documentation. Unfortunately, that’s rarely the case, so readr provides guess_encoding() to help you figure it out. It’s not foolproof and works better when you have lots of text (unlike here), but it’s a reasonable place to start. Expect to try a few different encodings before you find the right one.\nEncodings are a rich and complex topic; we’ve only scratched the surface here. If you’d like to learn more, we recommend reading the detailed explanation at http://kunststube.net/encoding/.\n\n14.6.2 Letter variations\nWorking in languages with accents poses a significant challenge when determining the position of letters (e.g., with str_length() and str_sub()) as accented letters might be encoded as a single individual character (e.g., ü) or as two characters by combining an unaccented letter (e.g., u) with a diacritic mark (e.g., ¨). For example, this code shows two ways of representing ü that look identical:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBut both strings differ in length, and their first characters are different:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFinally, note that a comparison of these strings with == interprets these strings as different, while the handy str_equal() function in stringr recognizes that both have the same appearance:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n14.6.3 Locale-dependent functions\nFinally, there are a handful of stringr functions whose behavior depends on your locale. A locale is similar to a language but includes an optional region specifier to handle regional variations within a language. A locale is specified by a lower-case language abbreviation, optionally followed by a _ and an upper-case region identifier. For example, “en” is English, “en_GB” is British English, and “en_US” is American English. If you don’t already know the code for your language, Wikipedia has a good list, and you can see which are supported in stringr by looking at stringi::stri_locale_list().\nBase R string functions automatically use the locale set by your operating system. This means that base R string functions do what you expect for your language, but your code might work differently if you share it with someone who lives in a different country. To avoid this problem, stringr defaults to English rules by using the “en” locale and requires you to specify the locale argument to override it. Fortunately, there are two sets of functions where the locale really matters: changing case and sorting.\nThe rules for changing cases differ among languages. For example, Turkish has two i’s: with and without a dot. Since they’re two distinct letters, they’re capitalized differently:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSorting strings depends on the order of the alphabet, and the order of the alphabet is not the same in every language9! Here’s an example: in Czech, “ch” is a compound letter that appears after h in the alphabet.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis also comes up when sorting strings with dplyr::arrange(), which is why it also has a locale argument.",

When this is supplied, str_view() will show only the elements of the string vector that match, surrounding each match with &lt;&gt;, and, where possible, highlighting the match in blue.\nThe simplest patterns consist of letters and numbers which match those characters exactly:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nLetters and numbers match exactly and are called literal characters. Most punctuation characters, like ., +, *, [, ], and ?, have special meanings2 and are called metacharacters. For example, . will match any character3, so \"a.\" will match any string that contains an “a” followed by another character :\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr we could find all the fruits that contain an “a”, followed by three letters, followed by an “e”:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nQuantifiers control how many times a pattern can match:\n\n? makes a pattern optional (i.e. it matches 0 or 1 times)\n+ lets a pattern repeat (i.e. it matches at least once)\n* lets a pattern be optional or repeat (i.e. it matches any number of times, including 0).\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nCharacter classes are defined by [] and let you match a set of characters, e.g., [abcd] matches “a”, “b”, “c”, or “d”.

It looks like they’ve radically increased in popularity lately!\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere are two functions that are closely related to str_detect(): str_subset() and str_which(). str_subset() returns a character vector containing only the strings that match. str_which() returns an integer vector giving the positions of the strings that match.\n\n\n15.3.2 Count matches\nThe next step up in complexity from str_detect() is str_count(): rather than a true or false, it tells you how many matches there are in each string.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that each match starts at the end of the previous match, i.e. regex matches never overlap. For example, in \"abababa\", how many times will the pattern \"aba\" match? Regular expressions say two, not three:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s natural to use str_count() with mutate(). The following example uses str_count() with character classes to count the number of vowels and consonants in each name.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you look closely, you’ll notice that there’s something off with our calculations: “Aaban” contains three “a”s, but our summary reports only two vowels. That’s because regular expressions are case sensitive. There are three ways we could fix this:\n\nAdd the upper case vowels to the character class: str_count(name, \"[aeiouAEIOU]\").\nTell the regular expression to ignore case: str_count(name, regex(\"[aeiou]\", ignore_case = TRUE)). We’ll talk about more in Section 15.5.1.\nUse str_to_lower() to convert the names to lower case: str_count(str_to_lower(name), \"[aeiou]\").\n\nThis variety of approaches is pretty typical when working with strings — there are often multiple ways to reach your goal, either by making your pattern more complicated or by doing some preprocessing on your string. If you get stuck trying one approach, it can often be useful to switch gears and tackle the problem from a different perspective.\nIn this case, since we’re applying two functions to the name, I think it’s easier to transform it first:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n15.3.3 Replace values\nAs well as detecting and counting matches, we can also modify them with str_replace() and str_replace_all(). str_replace() replaces the first match, and as the name suggests, str_replace_all() replaces all matches.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nstr_remove() and str_remove_all() are handy shortcuts for str_replace(x, pattern, \"\"):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThese functions are naturally paired with mutate() when doing data cleaning, and you’ll often apply them repeatedly to peel off layers of inconsistent formatting.\n\n\n15.3.4 Extract variables\nThe last function we’ll discuss uses regular expressions to extract data out of one column into one or more new columns: separate_wider_regex(). It’s a peer of the separate_wider_position() and separate_wider_delim() functions that you learned about in Section 14.4.2. These functions live in tidyr because they operate on (columns of) data frames, rather than individual vectors.\nLet’s create a simple dataset to show how it works. Here we have some data derived from babynames where we have the name, gender, and age of a bunch of people in a rather weird format5:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo extract this data using separate_wider_regex() we just need to construct a sequence of regular expressions that match each piece. If we want the contents of that piece to appear in the output, we give it a name:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf the match fails, you can use too_few = \"debug\" to figure out what went wrong, just like separate_wider_delim() and separate_wider_position().\n\n\n15.3.5 Exercises\n\nWhat baby name has the most vowels? What name has the highest proportion of vowels? (Hint: what is the denominator?)\nReplace all forward slashes in \"a/b/c/d/e\" with backslashes. What happens if you attempt to undo the transformation by replacing all backslashes with forward slashes? (We’ll discuss the problem very soon.)\nImplement a simple version of str_to_lower() using str_replace_all().\nCreate a regular expression that will match telephone numbers as commonly written in your country.",

    "text": "15.4 Pattern details\nNow that you understand the basics of the pattern language and how to use it with some stringr and tidyr functions, it’s time to dig into more of the details. First, we’ll start with escaping, which allows you to match metacharacters that would otherwise be treated specially. Next, you’ll learn about anchors which allow you to match the start or end of the string. Then, you’ll learn more about character classes and their shortcuts which allow you to match any character from a set. Next, you’ll learn the final details of quantifiers which control how many times a pattern can match. Then, we have to cover the important (but complex) topic of operator precedence and parentheses. And we’ll finish off with some details of grouping components of the pattern.\nThe terms we use here are the technical names for each component. They’re not always the most evocative of their purpose, but it’s very helpful to know the correct terms if you later want to Google for more details.\n\n15.4.1 Escaping\nIn order to match a literal ., you need an escape which tells the regular expression to match metacharacters6 literally. Like strings, regexps use the backslash for escaping. So, to match a ., you need the regexp \\.. Unfortunately this creates a problem. We use strings to represent regular expressions, and \\ is also used as an escape symbol in strings. So to create the regular expression \\. we need the string \"\\\\.\", as the following example shows.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this book, we’ll usually write regular expression without quotes, like \\.. If we need to emphasize what you’ll actually type, we’ll surround it with quotes and add extra escapes, like \"\\\\.\".\nIf \\ is used as an escape character in regular expressions, how do you match a literal \\? Well, you need to escape it, creating the regular expression \\\\. To create that regular expression, you need to use a string, which also needs to escape \\. That means to match a literal \\ you need to write \"\\\\\\\\\" — you need four backslashes to match one!\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAlternatively, you might find it easier to use the raw strings you learned about in Section 14.2.2). That lets you avoid one layer of escaping:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you’re trying to match a literal ., $, |, *, +, ?, {, }, (, ), there’s an alternative to using a backslash escape: you can use a character class: [.], [$], [|], … all match the literal values.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n15.4.2 Anchors\nBy default, regular expressions will match any part of a string. If you want to match at the start or end you need to anchor the regular expression using ^ to match the start or $ to match the end:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s tempting to think that $ should match the start of a string, because that’s how we write dollar amounts, but that’s not what regular expressions want.\nTo force a regular expression to match only the full string, anchor it with both ^ and $:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also match the boundary between words (i.e. the start or end of a word) with \\b. This can be particularly useful when using RStudio’s find and replace tool. For example, if to find all uses of sum(), you can search for \\bsum\\b to avoid matching summarize, summary, rowsum and so on:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen used alone, anchors will produce a zero-width match:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis helps you understand what happens when you replace a standalone anchor:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n15.4.3 Character classes\nA character class, or character set, allows you to match any character in a set. As we discussed above, you can construct your own sets with [], where [abc] matches “a”, “b”, or “c” and [^abc] matches any character except “a”, “b”, or “c”. Apart from ^ there are two other characters that have special meaning inside of []:\n\n- defines a range, e.g., [a-z] matches any lower case letter and [0-9] matches any number.\n\\ escapes special characters, so [\\^\\-\\]] matches ^, -, or ].\n\nHere are few examples:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSome character classes are used so commonly that they get their own shortcut. You’ve already seen ., which matches any character apart from a newline. There are three other particularly useful pairs7:\n\n\\d matches any digit;\n\\D matches anything that isn’t a digit.\n\\s matches any whitespace (e.g., space, tab, newline);\n\\S matches anything that isn’t whitespace.\n\\w matches any “word” character, i.e. letters and numbers;\n\\W matches any “non-word” character.\n\nThe following code demonstrates the six shortcuts with a selection of letters, numbers, and punctuation characters.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n15.4.4 Quantifiers\nQuantifiers control how many times a pattern matches. In Section 15.2 you learned about ? (0 or 1 matches), + (1 or more matches), and * (0 or more matches). For example, colou?r will match American or British spelling, \\d+ will match one or more digits, and \\s? will optionally match a single item of whitespace. You can also specify the number of matches precisely with {}:\n\n{n} matches exactly n times.\n{n,} matches at least n times.\n{n,m} matches between n and m times.\n\n\n\n15.4.5 Operator precedence and parentheses\nWhat does ab+ match? Does it match “a” followed by one or more “b”s, or does it match “ab” repeated any number of times? What does ^a|b$ match? Does it match the complete string a or the complete string b, or does it match a string starting with a or a string ending with b?\nThe answer to these questions is determined by operator precedence, similar to the PEMDAS or BEDMAS rules you might have learned in school. You know that a + b * c is equivalent to a + (b * c) not (a + b) * c because * has higher precedence and + has lower precedence: you compute * before +.\nSimilarly, regular expressions have their own precedence rules: quantifiers have high precedence and alternation has low precedence which means that ab+ is equivalent to a(b+), and ^a|b$ is equivalent to (^a)|(b$). Just like with algebra, you can use parentheses to override the usual order. But unlike algebra you’re unlikely to remember the precedence rules for regexes, so feel free to use parentheses liberally.\n\n\n15.4.6 Grouping and capturing\nAs well as overriding operator precedence, parentheses have another important effect: they create capturing groups that allow you to use sub-components of the match.\nThe first way to use a capturing group is to refer back to it within a match with back reference: \\1 refers to the match contained in the first parenthesis, \\2 in the second parenthesis, and so on. For example, the following pattern finds all fruits that have a repeated pair of letters:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnd this one finds all words that start and end with the same pair of letters:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also use back references in str_replace(). For example, this code switches the order of the second and third words in sentences:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you want to extract the matches for each group you can use str_match(). But str_match() returns a matrix, so it’s not particularly easy to work with8:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou could convert to a tibble and name the columns:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBut then you’ve basically recreated your own version of separate_wider_regex(). Indeed, behind the scenes, separate_wider_regex() converts your vector of patterns to a single regex that uses grouping to capture the named components.\nOccasionally, you’ll want to use parentheses without creating matching groups. You can create a non-capturing group with (?:).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n15.4.7 Exercises\n\nHow would you match the literal string \"'\\? How about \"$^$\"?\nExplain why each of these patterns don’t match a \\: \"\\\", \"\\\\\", \"\\\\\\\".\nGiven the corpus of common words in stringr::words, create regular expressions that find all words that:\n\nStart with “y”.\nDon’t start with “y”.\nEnd with “x”.\nAre exactly three letters long. (Don’t cheat by using str_length()!)\nHave seven letters or more.\nContain a vowel-consonant pair.\nContain at least two vowel-consonant pairs in a row.\nOnly consist of repeated vowel-consonant pairs.\n\nCreate 11 regular expressions that match the British or American spellings for each of the following words: airplane/aeroplane, aluminum/aluminium, analog/analogue, ass/arse, center/centre, defense/defence, donut/doughnut, gray/grey, modeling/modelling, skeptic/sceptic, summarize/summarise. Try and make the shortest possible regex!\nSwitch the first and last letters in words. Which of those strings are still words?\nDescribe in words what these regular expressions match: (read carefully to see if each entry is a regular expression or a string that defines a regular expression.)\n\n^.*$\n\"\\\\{.+\\\\}\"\n\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}\n\"\\\\\\\\{4}\"\n\\..\\..\\..\n(.)\\1\\1\n\"(..)\\\\1\"\n\nSolve the beginner regexp crosswords at https://regexcrossword.com/challenges/beginner.",

    "text": "15.5 Pattern control\nIt’s possible to exercise extra control over the details of the match by using a pattern object instead of just a string. This allows you to control the so called regex flags and match various types of fixed strings, as described below.\n\n15.5.1 Regex flags\nThere are a number of settings that can be used to control the details of the regexp. These settings are often called flags in other programming languages. In stringr, you can use these by wrapping the pattern in a call to regex(). The most useful flag is probably ignore_case = TRUE because it allows characters to match either their uppercase or lowercase forms:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you’re doing a lot of work with multiline strings (i.e. strings that contain \\n), dotalland multiline may also be useful:\n\ndotall = TRUE lets . match everything, including \\n:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nmultiline = TRUE makes ^ and $ match the start and end of each line rather than the start and end of the complete string:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nFinally, if you’re writing a complicated regular expression and you’re worried you might not understand it in the future, you might try comments = TRUE. It tweaks the pattern language to ignore spaces and new lines, as well as everything after #. This allows you to use comments and whitespace to make complex regular expressions more understandable9, as in the following example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you’re using comments and want to match a space, newline, or #, you’ll need to escape it with \\.\n\n\n15.5.2 Fixed matches\nYou can opt-out of the regular expression rules by using fixed():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nfixed() also gives you the ability to ignore case:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you’re working with non-English text, you will probably want coll() instead of fixed(), as it implements the full rules for capitalization as used by the locale you specify.

We’ll discuss three general techniques:\n\nchecking your work by creating simple positive and negative controls\ncombining regular expressions with Boolean algebra\ncreating complex patterns using string manipulation\n\n\n15.6.1 Check your work\nFirst, let’s find all sentences that start with “The”. Using the ^ anchor alone is not enough:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBecause that pattern also matches sentences starting with words like They or These. We need to make sure that the “e” is the last letter in the word, which we can do by adding a word boundary:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhat about finding all sentences that begin with a pronoun?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nA quick inspection of the results shows that we’re getting some spurious matches. That’s because we’ve forgotten to use parentheses:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou might wonder how you might spot such a mistake if it didn’t occur in the first few matches. A good technique is to create a few positive and negative matches and use them to test that your pattern works as expected:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s typically much easier to come up with good positive examples than negative examples, because it takes a while before you’re good enough with regular expressions to predict where your weaknesses are. Nevertheless, they’re still useful: as you work on the problem you can slowly accumulate a collection of your mistakes, ensuring that you never make the same mistake twice.\n\n\n15.6.2 Boolean operations\nImagine we want to find words that only contain consonants. One technique is to create a character class that contains all letters except for the vowels ([^aeiou]), then allow that to match any number of letters ([^aeiou]+), then force it to match the whole string by anchoring to the beginning and the end (^[^aeiou]+$):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBut you can make this problem a bit easier by flipping the problem around. Instead of looking for words that contain only consonants, we could look for words that don’t contain any vowels:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis is a useful technique whenever you’re dealing with logical combinations, particularly those involving “and” or “not”. For example, imagine if you want to find all words that contain “a” and “b”. There’s no “and” operator built in to regular expressions so we have to tackle it by looking for all words that contain an “a” followed by a “b”, or a “b” followed by an “a”:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s simpler to combine the results of two calls to str_detect():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhat if we wanted to see if there was a word that contains all vowels? If we did it with patterns we’d need to generate 5! (120) different patterns:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s much simpler to combine five calls to str_detect():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn general, if you get stuck trying to create a single regexp that solves your problem, take a step back and think if you could break the problem down into smaller pieces, solving each challenge before moving onto the next one.\n\n\n15.6.3 Creating a pattern with code\nWhat if we wanted to find all sentences that mention a color? The basic idea is simple: we just combine alternation with word boundaries.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBut as the number of colors grows, it would quickly get tedious to construct this pattern by hand. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could store the colors in a vector?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWell, we can! We’d just need to create the pattern from the vector using str_c() and str_flatten():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe could make this pattern more comprehensive if we had a good list of colors. One place we could start from is the list of built-in colors that R can use for plots:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBut lets first eliminate the numbered variants:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThen we can turn this into one giant pattern. We won’t show the pattern here because it’s huge, but you can see it working:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this example, cols only contains numbers and letters so you don’t need to worry about metacharacters. But in general, whenever you create patterns from existing strings it’s wise to run them through str_escape() to ensure they match literally.\n\n\n15.6.4 Exercises\n\nFor each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple str_detect() calls.\n\nFind all words that start or end with x.\nFind all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.\nAre there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?\n\nConstruct patterns to find evidence for and against the rule “i before e except after c”?\ncolors() contains a number of modifiers like “lightgray” and “darkblue”. How could you automatically identify these modifiers? (Think about how you might detect and then remove the colors that are modified).\nCreate a regular expression that finds any base R dataset. You can get a list of these datasets via a special use of the data() function: data(package = \"datasets\")$results[, \"Item\"]. Note that a number of old datasets are individual vectors; these contain the name of the grouping “data frame” in parentheses, so you’ll need to strip those off.",

The following sections describe some other useful functions in the wider tidyverse and base R.\n\n15.7.1 tidyverse\nThere are three other particularly useful places where you might want to use a regular expressions\n\nmatches(pattern) will select all variables whose name matches the supplied pattern. It’s a “tidyselect” function that you can use anywhere in any tidyverse function that selects variables (e.g., select(), rename_with() and across()).\npivot_longer()'s names_pattern argument takes a vector of regular expressions, just like separate_wider_regex(). It’s useful when extracting data out of variable names with a complex structure\nThe delim argument in separate_longer_delim() and separate_wider_delim() usually matches a fixed string, but you can use regex() to make it match a pattern. This is useful, for example, if you want to match a comma that is optionally followed by a space, i.e. regex(\", ?\").\n\n\n\n15.7.2 Base R\napropos(pattern) searches all objects available from the global environment that match the given pattern. This is useful if you can’t quite remember the name of a function:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nlist.files(path, pattern) lists all files in path that match a regular expression pattern.

That’s because stringr is built on top of the stringi package, which is in turn built on top of the ICU engine, whereas base R functions use either the TRE engine or the PCRE engine, depending on whether or not you’ve set perl = TRUE. Fortunately, the basics of regular expressions are so well established that you’ll encounter few variations when working with the patterns you’ll learn in this book. You only need to be aware of the difference when you start to rely on advanced features like complex Unicode character ranges or special features that use the (?…) syntax.",

They’re definitely confusing at first but as you train your eyes to read them and your brain to understand them, you unlock a powerful skill that you can use in R and in many other places.\nIn this chapter, you’ve started your journey to become a regular expression master by learning the most useful stringr functions and the most important components of the regular expression language. And there are plenty of resources to learn more.\nA good place to start is vignette(\"regular-expressions\", package = \"stringr\"): it documents the full set of syntax supported by stringr. Another useful reference is https://www.regular-expressions.info/. It’s not R specific, but you can use it to learn about the most advanced features of regexes and how they work under the hood.\nIt’s also good to know that stringr is implemented on top of the stringi package by Marek Gagolewski. If you’re struggling to find a function that does what you need in stringr, don’t be afraid to look in stringi. You’ll find stringi very easy to pick up because it follows many of the the same conventions as stringr.\nIn the next chapter, we’ll talk about a data structure closely related to strings: factors. Factors are used to represent categorical data in R, i.e. data with a fixed and known set of possible values identified by a vector of strings.",

For example, imagine you want to explore the average number of hours spent watching TV per day across religions:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt is hard to read this plot because there’s no overall pattern. We can improve it by reordering the levels of relig using fct_reorder(). fct_reorder() takes three arguments:\n\n.f, the factor whose levels you want to modify.\n.x, a numeric vector that you want to use to reorder the levels.\nOptionally, .fun, a function that’s used if there are multiple values of .x for each value of .f. The default value is median.\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nReordering religion makes it much easier to see that people in the “Don’t know” category watch much more TV, and Hinduism & Other Eastern religions watch much less.\nAs you start making more complicated transformations, we recommend moving them out of aes() and into a separate mutate() step. For example, you could rewrite the plot above as:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhat if we create a similar plot looking at how average age varies across reported income level?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere, arbitrarily reordering the levels isn’t a good idea! That’s because rincome already has a principled order that we shouldn’t mess with. Reserve fct_reorder() for factors whose levels are arbitrarily ordered.\nHowever, it does make sense to pull “Not applicable” to the front with the other special levels. You can use fct_relevel(). It takes a factor, .f, and then any number of levels that you want to move to the front of the line.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhy do you think the average age for “Not applicable” is so high?\nAnother type of reordering is useful when you are coloring the lines on a plot. fct_reorder2(.f, .x, .y) reorders the factor .f by the .y values associated with the largest .x values. This makes the plot easier to read because the colors of the line at the far right of the plot will line up with the legend.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFinally, for bar plots, you can use fct_infreq() to order levels in decreasing frequency: this is the simplest type of reordering because it doesn’t need any extra variables. Combine it with fct_rev() if you want them in increasing frequency so that in the bar plot largest values are on the right, not the left.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n16.4.1 Exercises\n\nThere are some suspiciously high numbers in tvhours.

This allows you to clarify labels for publication, and collapse levels for high-level displays. The most general and powerful tool is fct_recode(). It allows you to recode, or change, the value of each level. For example, take the partyid variable from the gss_cat data frame:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe levels are terse and inconsistent.

You can recognize them when printing because they use &lt; between the factor levels:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn practice, ordered() factors behave very similarly to regular factors.

These are mildly useful, but you are unlikely to have heard of them unless you have a PhD in Statistics, and even then you probably don’t routinely interpret them.

You use them all the time in your regular life, and they don’t seem to cause much confusion. However, the more you learn about dates and times, the more complicated they seem to get!\nTo warm up think about how many days there are in a year, and how many hours there are in a day. You probably remembered that most years have 365 days, but leap years have 366. Do you know the full rule for determining if a year is a leap year1? The number of hours in a day is a little less obvious: most days have 24 hours, but in places that use daylight saving time (DST), one day each year has 23 hours and another has 25.\nDates and times are hard because they have to reconcile two physical phenomena (the rotation of the Earth and its orbit around the sun) with a whole raft of geopolitical phenomena including months, time zones, and DST. This chapter won’t teach you every last detail about dates and times, but it will give you a solid grounding of practical skills that will help you with common data analysis challenges.\nWe’ll begin by showing you how to create date-times from various inputs, and then once you’ve got a date-time, how you can extract components like year, month, and day. We’ll then dive into the tricky topic of working with time spans, which come in a variety of flavors depending on what you’re trying to do. We’ll conclude with a brief discussion of the additional challenges posed by time zones.",

    "text": "17.2 Creating date/times\nThere are three types of date/time data that refer to an instant in time:\n\nA date. Tibbles print this as &lt;date&gt;.\nA time within a day. Tibbles print this as &lt;time&gt;.\nA date-time is a date plus a time: it uniquely identifies an instant in time (typically to the nearest second). Tibbles print this as &lt;dttm&gt;. Base R calls these POSIXct, but that doesn’t exactly trip off the tongue.\n\nIn this chapter we are going to focus on dates and date-times as R doesn’t have a native class for storing times. If you need one, you can use the hms package.\nYou should always use the simplest possible data type that works for your needs. That means if you can use a date instead of a date-time, you should. Date-times are substantially more complicated because of the need to handle time zones, which we’ll come back to at the end of the chapter.\nTo get the current date or date-time you can use today() or now():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOtherwise, the following sections describe the four ways you’re likely to create a date/time:\n\nWhile reading a file with readr.\nFrom a string.\nFrom individual date-time components.\nFrom an existing date/time object.\n\n\n17.2.1 During import\nIf your CSV contains an ISO8601 date or date-time, you don’t need to do anything; readr will automatically recognize it:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you haven’t heard of ISO8601 before, it’s an international standard2 for writing dates where the components of a date are organized from biggest to smallest separated by -. For example, in ISO8601 May 3 2022 is 2022-05-03. ISO8601 dates can also include times, where hour, minute, and second are separated by :, and the date and time components are separated by either a T or a space. For example, you could write 4:26pm on May 3 2022 as either 2022-05-03 16:26 or 2022-05-03T16:26.\nFor other date-time formats, you’ll need to use col_types plus col_date() or col_datetime() along with a date-time format. The date-time format used by readr is a standard used across many programming languages, describing a date component with a % followed by a single character. For example, %Y-%m-%d specifies a date that’s a year, -, month (as number) -, day. Table Table 17.1 lists all the options.\n\n\n\nTable 17.1: All date formats understood by readr\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nCode\nMeaning\nExample\n\n\n\n\nYear\n%Y\n4 digit year\n2021\n\n\n\n%y\n2 digit year\n21\n\n\nMonth\n%m\nNumber\n2\n\n\n\n%b\nAbbreviated name\nFeb\n\n\n\n%B\nFull name\nFebruary\n\n\nDay\n%d\nOne or two digits\n2\n\n\n\n%e\nTwo digits\n02\n\n\nTime\n%H\n24-hour hour\n13\n\n\n\n%I\n12-hour hour\n1\n\n\n\n%p\nAM/PM\npm\n\n\n\n%M\nMinutes\n35\n\n\n\n%S\nSeconds\n45\n\n\n\n%OS\nSeconds with decimal component\n45.35\n\n\n\n%Z\nTime zone name\nAmerica/Chicago\n\n\n\n%z\nOffset from UTC\n+0800\n\n\nOther\n%.\nSkip one non-digit\n:\n\n\n\n%*\nSkip any number of non-digits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this code shows a few options applied to a very ambiguous date:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that no matter how you specify the date format, it’s always displayed the same way once you get it into R.\nIf you’re using %b or %B and working with non-English dates, you’ll also need to provide a locale(). See the list of built-in languages in date_names_langs(), or create your own with date_names(),\n\n\n17.2.2 From strings\nThe date-time specification language is powerful, but requires careful analysis of the date format. An alternative approach is to use lubridate’s helpers which attempt to automatically determine the format once you specify the order of the component. To use them, identify the order in which year, month, and day appear in your dates, then arrange “y”, “m”, and “d” in the same order. That gives you the name of the lubridate function that will parse your date. For example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nymd() and friends create dates. To create a date-time, add an underscore and one or more of “h”, “m”, and “s” to the name of the parsing function:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also force the creation of a date-time from a date by supplying a timezone:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere I use the UTC3 timezone which you might also know as GMT, or Greenwich Mean Time, the time at 0° longitude4 . It doesn’t use daylight saving time, making it a bit easier to compute with .\n\n\n17.2.3 From individual components\nInstead of a single string, sometimes you’ll have the individual components of the date-time spread across multiple columns. This is what we have in the flights data:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo create a date/time from this sort of input, use make_date() for dates, or make_datetime() for date-times:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nLet’s do the same thing for each of the four time columns in flights. The times are represented in a slightly odd format, so we use modulus arithmetic to pull out the hour and minute components. Once we’ve created the date-time variables, we focus in on the variables we’ll explore in the rest of the chapter.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWith this data, we can visualize the distribution of departure times across the year:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr within a single day:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that when you use date-times in a numeric context (like in a histogram), 1 means 1 second, so a binwidth of 86400 means one day. For dates, 1 means 1 day.\n\n\n17.2.4 From other types\nYou may want to switch between a date-time and a date. That’s the job of as_datetime() and as_date():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSometimes you’ll get date/times as numeric offsets from the “Unix Epoch”, 1970-01-01. If the offset is in seconds, use as_datetime(); if it’s in days, use as_date().\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n17.2.5 Exercises\n\nWhat happens if you parse a string that contains invalid dates?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhat does the tzone argument to today() do? Why is it important?\nFor each of the following date-times, show how you’d parse it using a readr column specification and a lubridate function.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

This section will focus on the accessor functions that let you get and set individual components. The next section will look at how arithmetic works with date-times.\n\n17.3.1 Getting components\nYou can pull out individual parts of the date with the accessor functions year(), month(), mday() (day of the month), yday() (day of the year), wday() (day of the week), hour(), minute(), and second(). These are effectively the opposites of make_datetime().\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFor month() and wday() you can set label = TRUE to return the abbreviated name of the month or day of the week. Set abbr = FALSE to return the full name.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can use wday() to see that more flights depart during the week than on the weekend:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can also look at the average departure delay by minute within the hour. There’s an interesting pattern: flights leaving in minutes 20-30 and 50-60 have much lower delays than the rest of the hour!\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nInterestingly, if we look at the scheduled departure time we don’t see such a strong pattern:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSo why do we see that pattern with the actual departure times? Well, like much data collected by humans, there’s a strong bias towards flights leaving at “nice” departure times, as ?fig-human-rounding shows. Always be alert for this sort of pattern whenever you work with data that involves human judgement!\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n17.3.2 Rounding\nAn alternative approach to plotting individual components is to round the date to a nearby unit of time, with floor_date(), round_date(), and ceiling_date(). Each function takes a vector of dates to adjust and then the name of the unit to round down (floor), round up (ceiling), or round to. This, for example, allows us to plot the number of flights per week:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can use rounding to show the distribution of flights across the course of a day by computing the difference between dep_time and the earliest instant of that day:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nComputing the difference between a pair of date-times yields a difftime (more on that in Section 17.4.3). We can convert that to an hms object to get a more useful x-axis:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n17.3.3 Modifying components\nYou can also use each accessor function to modify the components of a date/time. This doesn’t come up much in data analysis, but can be useful when cleaning data that has clearly incorrect dates.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAlternatively, rather than modifying an existing variable, you can create a new date-time with update(). This also allows you to set multiple values in one step:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf values are too big, they will roll-over:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n17.3.4 Exercises\n\nHow does the distribution of flight times within a day change over the course of the year?\nCompare dep_time, sched_dep_time and dep_delay. Are they consistent? Explain your findings.\nCompare air_time with the duration between the departure and arrival. Explain your findings. (Hint: consider the location of the airport.)\nHow does the average delay time change over the course of a day? Should you use dep_time or sched_dep_time? Why?\nOn what day of the week should you leave if you want to minimise the chance of a delay?\nWhat makes the distribution of diamonds$carat and flights$sched_dep_time similar?\nConfirm our hypothesis that the early departures of flights in minutes 20-30 and 50-60 are caused by scheduled flights that leave early.

If you only care about physical time, use a duration; if you need to add human times, use a period; if you need to figure out how long a span is in human units, use an interval.\n\n17.4.1 Durations\nIn R, when you subtract two dates, you get a difftime object:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nA difftime class object records a time span of seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks. This ambiguity can make difftimes a little painful to work with, so lubridate provides an alternative which always uses seconds: the duration.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nDurations come with a bunch of convenient constructors:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nDurations always record the time span in seconds. Larger units are created by converting minutes, hours, days, weeks, and years to seconds: 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, and 7 days in a week. Larger time units are more problematic. A year uses the “average” number of days in a year, i.e. 365.25. There’s no way to convert a month to a duration, because there’s just too much variation.\nYou can add and multiply durations:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can add and subtract durations to and from days:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHowever, because durations represent an exact number of seconds, sometimes you might get an unexpected result:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhy is one day after 1am March 8, 2am March 9? If you look carefully at the date you might also notice that the time zones have changed. March 8 only has 23 hours because it’s when DST starts, so if we add a full days worth of seconds we end up with a different time.\n\n\n17.4.2 Periods\nTo solve this problem, lubridate provides periods. Periods are time spans but don’t have a fixed length in seconds, instead they work with “human” times, like days and months. That allows them to work in a more intuitive way:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nLike durations, periods can be created with a number of friendly constructor functions.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can add and multiply periods:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnd of course, add them to dates. Compared to durations, periods are more likely to do what you expect:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nLet’s use periods to fix an oddity related to our flight dates. Some planes appear to have arrived at their destination before they departed from New York City.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThese are overnight flights. We used the same date information for both the departure and the arrival times, but these flights arrived on the following day. We can fix this by adding days(1) to the arrival time of each overnight flight.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow all of our flights obey the laws of physics.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n17.4.3 Intervals\nWhat does dyears(1) / ddays(365) return? It’s not quite one, because dyears() is defined as the number of seconds per average year, which is 365.25 days.\nWhat does years(1) / days(1) return? Well, if the year was 2015 it should return 365, but if it was 2016, it should return 366! There’s not quite enough information for lubridate to give a single clear answer. What it does instead is give an estimate:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you want a more accurate measurement, you’ll have to use an interval. An interval is a pair of starting and ending date times, or you can think of it as a duration with a starting point.\nYou can create an interval by writing start %--% end:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou could then divide it by days() to find out how many days fit in the year:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n17.4.4 Exercises\n\nExplain days(!overnight) and days(overnight) to someone who has just started learning R. What is the key fact you need to know?\nCreate a vector of dates giving the first day of every month in 2015. Create a vector of dates giving the first day of every month in the current year.\nWrite a function that given your birthday (as a date), returns how old you are in years.\nWhy can’t (today() %--% (today() + years(1))) / months(1) work?",

    "text": "17.5 Time zones\nTime zones are an enormously complicated topic because of their interaction with geopolitical entities. Fortunately we don’t need to dig into all the details as they’re not all important for data analysis, but there are a few challenges we’ll need to tackle head on.\n\nThe first challenge is that everyday names of time zones tend to be ambiguous. For example, if you’re American you’re probably familiar with EST, or Eastern Standard Time. However, both Australia and Canada also have EST! To avoid confusion, R uses the international standard IANA time zones. These use a consistent naming scheme {area}/{location}, typically in the form {continent}/{city} or {ocean}/{city}. Examples include “America/New_York”, “Europe/Paris”, and “Pacific/Auckland”.\nYou might wonder why the time zone uses a city, when typically you think of time zones as associated with a country or region within a country. This is because the IANA database has to record decades worth of time zone rules. Over the course of decades, countries change names (or break apart) fairly frequently, but city names tend to stay the same. Another problem is that the name needs to reflect not only the current behavior, but also the complete history. For example, there are time zones for both “America/New_York” and “America/Detroit”. These cities both currently use Eastern Standard Time but in 1969-1972 Michigan (the state in which Detroit is located), did not follow DST, so it needs a different name. It’s worth reading the raw time zone database (available at https://www.iana.org/time-zones) just to read some of these stories!\nYou can find out what R thinks your current time zone is with Sys.timezone():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n(If R doesn’t know, you’ll get an NA.)\nAnd see the complete list of all time zone names with OlsonNames():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn R, the time zone is an attribute of the date-time that only controls printing. For example, these three objects represent the same instant in time:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can verify that they’re the same time using subtraction:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUnless otherwise specified, lubridate always uses UTC. UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) is the standard time zone used by the scientific community and is roughly equivalent to GMT (Greenwich Mean Time). It does not have DST, which makes a convenient representation for computation. Operations that combine date-times, like c(), will often drop the time zone. In that case, the date-times will display in the time zone of the first element:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can change the time zone in two ways:\n\nKeep the instant in time the same, and change how it’s displayed. Use this when the instant is correct, but you want a more natural display.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n(This also illustrates another challenge of times zones: they’re not all integer hour offsets!)\nChange the underlying instant in time. Use this when you have an instant that has been labelled with the incorrect time zone, and you need to fix it.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "18.2 Explicit missing values\nTo begin, let’s explore a few handy tools for creating or eliminating missing explicit values, i.e. cells where you see an NA.\n\n18.2.1 Last observation carried forward\nA common use for missing values is as a data entry convenience. When data is entered by hand, missing values sometimes indicate that the value in the previous row has been repeated (or carried forward):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can fill in these missing values with tidyr::fill(). It works like select(), taking a set of columns:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis treatment is sometimes called “last observation carried forward”, or locf for short. You can use the .direction argument to fill in missing values that have been generated in more exotic ways.\n\n\n18.2.2 Fixed values\nSome times missing values represent some fixed and known value, most commonly 0. You can use dplyr::coalesce() to replace them:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSometimes you’ll hit the opposite problem where some concrete value actually represents a missing value. This typically arises in data generated by older software that doesn’t have a proper way to represent missing values, so it must instead use some special value like 99 or -999.\nIf possible, handle this when reading in the data, for example, by using the na argument to readr::read_csv(), e.g., read_csv(path, na = \"99\"). If you discover the problem later, or your data source doesn’t provide a way to handle it on read, you can use dplyr::na_if():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n18.2.3 NaN\nBefore we continue, there’s one special type of missing value that you’ll encounter from time to time: a NaN (pronounced “nan”), or not a number. It’s not that important to know about because it generally behaves just like NA:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn the rare case you need to distinguish an NA from a NaN, you can use is.nan(x).\nYou’ll generally encounter a NaN when you perform a mathematical operation that has an indeterminate result:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "section": "18.3 Implicit missing values",
    "text": "18.3 Implicit missing values\nSo far we’ve talked about missing values that are explicitly missing, i.e. you can see an NA in your data. But missing values can also be implicitly missing, if an entire row of data is simply absent from the data. Let’s illustrate the difference with a simple dataset that records the price of some stock each quarter:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis dataset has two missing observations:\n\nThe price in the fourth quarter of 2020 is explicitly missing, because its value is NA.\nThe price for the first quarter of 2021 is implicitly missing, because it simply does not appear in the dataset.\n\nOne way to think about the difference is with this Zen-like koan:\n\nAn explicit missing value is the presence of an absence.\n\nAn implicit missing value is the absence of a presence.\n\nSometimes you want to make implicit missings explicit in order to have something physical to work with. In other cases, explicit missings are forced upon you by the structure of the data and you want to get rid of them. The following sections discuss some tools for moving between implicit and explicit missingness.\n\n18.3.1 Pivoting\nYou’ve already seen one tool that can make implicit missings explicit and vice versa: pivoting. Making data wider can make implicit missing values explicit because every combination of the rows and new columns must have some value. For example, if we pivot stocks to put the quarter in the columns, both missing values become explicit:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBy default, making data longer preserves explicit missing values, but if they are structurally missing values that only exist because the data is not tidy, you can drop them (make them implicit) by setting values_drop_na = TRUE. See the examples in Section 5.2 for more details.\n\n\n18.3.2 Complete\ntidyr::complete() allows you to generate explicit missing values by providing a set of variables that define the combination of rows that should exist. For example, we know that all combinations of year and qtr should exist in the stocks data:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTypically, you’ll call complete() with names of existing variables, filling in the missing combinations. However, sometimes the individual variables are themselves incomplete, so you can instead provide your own data. For example, you might know that the stocks dataset is supposed to run from 2019 to 2021, so you could explicitly supply those values for year:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf the range of a variable is correct, but not all values are present, you could use full_seq(x, 1) to generate all values from min(x) to max(x) spaced out by 1.\nIn some cases, the complete set of observations can’t be generated by a simple combination of variables. In that case, you can do manually what complete() does for you: create a data frame that contains all the rows that should exist (using whatever combination of techniques you need), then combine it with your original dataset with dplyr::full_join().\n\n\n18.3.3 Joins\nThis brings us to another important way of revealing implicitly missing observations: joins. You’ll learn more about joins in Chapter 19, but we wanted to quickly mention them to you here since you can often only know that values are missing from one dataset when you compare it to another.\ndplyr::anti_join(x, y) is a particularly useful tool here because it selects only the rows in x that don’t have a match in y. For example, we can use two anti_join()s to reveal that we’re missing information for four airports and 722 planes mentioned in flights:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n18.3.4 Exercises\n\nCan you find any relationship between the carrier and the rows that appear to be missing from planes?",

    "text": "18.4 Factors and empty groups\nA final type of missingness is the empty group, a group that doesn’t contain any observations, which can arise when working with factors. For example, imagine we have a dataset that contains some health information about people:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnd we want to count the number of smokers with dplyr::count():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis dataset only contains non-smokers, but we know that smokers exist; the group of non-smokers is empty. We can request count() to keep all the groups, even those not seen in the data by using .drop = FALSE:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe same principle applies to ggplot2’s discrete axes, which will also drop levels that don’t have any values. You can force them to display by supplying drop = FALSE to the appropriate discrete axis:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe same problem comes up more generally with dplyr::group_by(). And again you can use .drop = FALSE to preserve all factor levels:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe get some interesting results here because when summarizing an empty group, the summary functions are applied to zero-length vectors. There’s an important distinction between empty vectors, which have length 0, and missing values, each of which has length 1.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAll summary functions work with zero-length vectors, but they may return results that are surprising at first glance. Here we see mean(age) returning NaN because mean(age) = sum(age)/length(age) which here is 0/0. max() and min() return -Inf and Inf for empty vectors so if you combine the results with a non-empty vector of new data and recompute you’ll get the minimum or maximum of the new data1.\nSometimes a simpler approach is to perform the summary and then make the implicit missings explicit with complete().\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe main drawback of this approach is that you get an NA for the count, even though you know that it should be zero.",

    "text": "19.2 Keys\nTo understand joins, you need to first understand how two tables can be connected through a pair of keys, within each table. In this section, you’ll learn about the two types of key and see examples of both in the datasets of the nycflights13 package. You’ll also learn how to check that your keys are valid, and what to do if your table lacks a key.\n\n19.2.1 Primary and foreign keys\nEvery join involves a pair of keys: a primary key and a foreign key. A primary key is a variable or set of variables that uniquely identifies each observation. When more than one variable is needed, the key is called a compound key. For example, in nycflights13:\n\n\nairlines records two pieces of data about each airline: its carrier code and its full name. You can identify an airline with its two letter carrier code, making carrier the primary key.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nairports records data about each airport. You can identify each airport by its three letter airport code, making faa the primary key.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nplanes records data about each plane. You can identify a plane by its tail number, making tailnum the primary key.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nweather records data about the weather at the origin airports. You can identify each observation by the combination of location and time, making origin and time_hour the compound primary key.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nA foreign key is a variable (or set of variables) that corresponds to a primary key in another table. For example:\n\n\nflights$tailnum is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key planes$tailnum.\n\nflights$carrier is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key airlines$carrier.\n\nflights$origin is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key airports$faa.\n\nflights$dest is a foreign key that corresponds to the primary key airports$faa.\n\nflights$origin-flights$time_hour is a compound foreign key that corresponds to the compound primary key weather$origin-weather$time_hour.\n\nThese relationships are summarized visually in Figure 19.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.1: Connections between all five data frames in the nycflights13 package. Variables making up a primary key are colored grey, and are connected to their corresponding foreign keys with arrows.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice a nice feature in the design of these keys: the primary and foreign keys almost always have the same names, which, as you’ll see shortly, will make your joining life much easier. It’s also worth noting the opposite relationship: almost every variable name used in multiple tables has the same meaning in each place. There’s only one exception: year means year of departure in flights and year of manufacturer in planes. This will become important when we start actually joining tables together.\n\n19.2.2 Checking primary keys\nNow that that we’ve identified the primary keys in each table, it’s good practice to verify that they do indeed uniquely identify each observation. One way to do that is to count() the primary keys and look for entries where n is greater than one. This reveals that planes and weather both look good:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou should also check for missing values in your primary keys — if a value is missing then it can’t identify an observation!\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n19.2.3 Surrogate keys\nSo far we haven’t talked about the primary key for flights. It’s not super important here, because there are no data frames that use it as a foreign key, but it’s still useful to consider because it’s easier to work with observations if we have some way to describe them to others.\nAfter a little thinking and experimentation, we determined that there are three variables that together uniquely identify each flight:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nDoes the absence of duplicates automatically make time_hour-carrier-flight a primary key? It’s certainly a good start, but it doesn’t guarantee it. For example, are altitude and latitude a good primary key for airports?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIdentifying an airport by its altitude and latitude is clearly a bad idea, and in general it’s not possible to know from the data alone whether or not a combination of variables makes a good a primary key. But for flights, the combination of time_hour, carrier, and flight seems reasonable because it would be really confusing for an airline and its customers if there were multiple flights with the same flight number in the air at the same time.\nThat said, we might be better off introducing a simple numeric surrogate key using the row number:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSurrogate keys can be particularly useful when communicating to other humans: it’s much easier to tell someone to take a look at flight 2001 than to say look at UA430 which departed 9am 2013-01-03.\n\n19.2.4 Exercises\n\nWe forgot to draw the relationship between weather and airports in Figure 19.1. What is the relationship and how should it appear in the diagram?\nweather only contains information for the three origin airports in NYC. If it contained weather records for all airports in the USA, what additional connection would it make to flights?\nThe year, month, day, hour, and origin variables almost form a compound key for weather, but there’s one hour that has duplicate observations. Can you figure out what’s special about that hour?\nWe know that some days of the year are special and fewer people than usual fly on them (e.g., Christmas eve and Christmas day). How might you represent that data as a data frame? What would be the primary key? How would it connect to the existing data frames?\nDraw a diagram illustrating the connections between the Batting, People, and Salaries data frames in the Lahman package. Draw another diagram that shows the relationship between People, Managers, AwardsManagers. How would you characterize the relationship between the Batting, Pitching, and Fielding data frames?",

    "section": "\n19.3 Basic joins",
    "text": "19.3 Basic joins\nNow that you understand how data frames are connected via keys, we can start using joins to better understand the flights dataset. dplyr provides six join functions: left_join(), inner_join(), right_join(), full_join(), semi_join(), and anti_join(). They all have the same interface: they take a pair of data frames (x and y) and return a data frame. The order of the rows and columns in the output is primarily determined by x.\nIn this section, you’ll learn how to use one mutating join, left_join(), and two filtering joins, semi_join() and anti_join(). In the next section, you’ll learn exactly how these functions work, and about the remaining inner_join(), right_join() and full_join().\n\n19.3.1 Mutating joins\nA mutating join allows you to combine variables from two data frames: it first matches observations by their keys, then copies across variables from one data frame to the other. Like mutate(), the join functions add variables to the right, so if your dataset has many variables, you won’t see the new ones. For these examples, we’ll make it easier to see what’s going on by creating a narrower dataset with just six variables1:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere are four types of mutating join, but there’s one that you’ll use almost all of the time: left_join(). It’s special because the output will always have the same rows as x, the data frame you’re joining to2. The primary use of left_join() is to add in additional metadata. For example, we can use left_join() to add the full airline name to the flights2 data:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr we could find out the temperature and wind speed when each plane departed:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr what size of plane was flying:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen left_join() fails to find a match for a row in x, it fills in the new variables with missing values. For example, there’s no information about the plane with tail number N3ALAA so the type, engines, and seats will be missing:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe’ll come back to this problem a few times in the rest of the chapter.\n\n19.3.2 Specifying join keys\nBy default, left_join() will use all variables that appear in both data frames as the join key, the so called natural join. This is a useful heuristic, but it doesn’t always work. For example, what happens if we try to join flights2 with the complete planes dataset?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe get a lot of missing matches because our join is trying to use tailnum and year as a compound key. Both flights and planes have a year column but they mean different things: flights$year is the year the flight occurred and planes$year is the year the plane was built. We only want to join on tailnum so we need to provide an explicit specification with join_by():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that the year variables are disambiguated in the output with a suffix (year.x and year.y), which tells you whether the variable came from the x or y argument. You can override the default suffixes with the suffix argument.\njoin_by(tailnum) is short for join_by(tailnum == tailnum). It’s important to know about this fuller form for two reasons. Firstly, it describes the relationship between the two tables: the keys must be equal. That’s why this type of join is often called an equi join. You’ll learn about non-equi joins in Section 19.5.\nSecondly, it’s how you specify different join keys in each table. For example, there are two ways to join the flight2 and airports table: either by dest or origin:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn older code you might see a different way of specifying the join keys, using a character vector:\n\n\nby = \"x\" corresponds to join_by(x).\n\nby = c(\"a\" = \"x\") corresponds to join_by(a == x).\n\nNow that it exists, we prefer join_by() since it provides a clearer and more flexible specification.\ninner_join(), right_join(), full_join() have the same interface as left_join(). The difference is which rows they keep: left join keeps all the rows in x, the right join keeps all rows in y, the full join keeps all rows in either x or y, and the inner join only keeps rows that occur in both x and y. We’ll come back to these in more detail later.\n\n19.3.3 Filtering joins\nAs you might guess the primary action of a filtering join is to filter the rows. There are two types: semi-joins and anti-joins. Semi-joins keep all rows in x that have a match in y. For example, we could use a semi-join to filter the airports dataset to show just the origin airports:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr just the destinations:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnti-joins are the opposite: they return all rows in x that don’t have a match in y. They’re useful for finding missing values that are implicit in the data, the topic of Section 18.3. Implicitly missing values don’t show up as NAs but instead only exist as an absence. For example, we can find rows that are missing from airports by looking for flights that don’t have a matching destination airport:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr we can find which tailnums are missing from planes:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n19.3.4 Exercises\n\nFind the 48 hours (over the course of the whole year) that have the worst delays. Cross-reference it with the weather data. Can you see any patterns?\n\nImagine you’ve found the top 10 most popular destinations using this code:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHow can you find all flights to those destinations?\n\nDoes every departing flight have corresponding weather data for that hour?\nWhat do the tail numbers that don’t have a matching record in planes have in common? (Hint: one variable explains ~90% of the problems.)\nAdd a column to planes that lists every carrier that has flown that plane. You might expect that there’s an implicit relationship between plane and airline, because each plane is flown by a single airline. Confirm or reject this hypothesis using the tools you’ve learned in previous chapters.\nAdd the latitude and the longitude of the origin and destination airport to flights. Is it easier to rename the columns before or after the join?\n\nCompute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here’s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou might want to use the size or color of the points to display the average delay for each airport.\n\n\nWhat happened on June 13 2013?

    "text": "19.4 How do joins work?\nNow that you’ve used joins a few times it’s time to learn more about how they work, focusing on how each row in x matches rows in y. We’ll begin by introducing a visual representation of joins, using the simple tibbles defined below and shown in Figure 19.2. In these examples we’ll use a single key called key and a single value column (val_x and val_y), but the ideas all generalize to multiple keys and multiple values.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.2: Graphical representation of two simple tables. The colored key columns map background color to key value. The grey columns represent the “value” columns that are carried along for the ride.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.3 introduces the foundation for our visual representation. It shows all potential matches between x and y as the intersection between lines drawn from each row of x and each row of y. The rows and columns in the output are primarily determined by x, so the x table is horizontal and lines up with the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.3: To understand how joins work, it’s useful to think of every possible match. Here we show that with a grid of connecting lines.\n\n\n\n\nTo describe a specific type of join, we indicate matches with dots. The matches determine the rows in the output, a new data frame that contains the key, the x values, and the y values. For example, Figure 19.4 shows an inner join, where rows are retained if and only if the keys are equal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.4: An inner join matches each row in x to the row in y that has the same value of key. Each match becomes a row in the output.\n\n\n\n\nWe can apply the same principles to explain the outer joins, which keep observations that appear in at least one of the data frames. These joins work by adding an additional “virtual” observation to each data frame. This observation has a key that matches if no other key matches, and values filled with NA. There are three types of outer joins:\n\n\nA left join keeps all observations in x, Figure 19.5. Every row of x is preserved in the output because it can fall back to matching a row of NAs in y.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.5: A visual representation of the left join where every row in x appears in the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA right join keeps all observations in y, Figure 19.6. Every row of y is preserved in the output because it can fall back to matching a row of NAs in x. The output still matches x as much as possible; any extra rows from y are added to the end.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.6: A visual representation of the right join where every row of y appears in the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA full join keeps all observations that appear in x or y, Figure 19.7. Every row of x and y is included in the output because both x and y have a fall back row of NAs. Again, the output starts with all rows from x, followed by the remaining unmatched y rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.7: A visual representation of the full join where every row in x and y appears in the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to show how the types of outer join differ is with a Venn diagram, as in Figure 19.8. However, this is not a great representation because while it might jog your memory about which rows are preserved, it fails to illustrate what’s happening with the columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.8: Venn diagrams showing the difference between inner, left, right, and full joins.\n\n\n\n\nThe joins shown here are the so-called equi joins, where rows match if the keys are equal. Equi joins are the most common type of join, so we’ll typically omit the equi prefix, and just say “inner join” rather than “equi inner join”. We’ll come back to non-equi joins in Section 19.5.\n\n19.4.1 Row matching\nSo far we’ve explored what happens if a row in x matches zero or one row in y. What happens if it matches more than one row? To understand what’s going let’s first narrow our focus to the inner_join() and then draw a picture, Figure 19.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.9: The three ways a row in x can match. x1 matches one row in y, x2 matches two rows in y, x3 matches zero rows in y. Note that while there are three rows in x and three rows in the output, there isn’t a direct correspondence between the rows.\n\n\n\n\nThere are three possible outcomes for a row in x:\n\nIf it doesn’t match anything, it’s dropped.\nIf it matches 1 row in y, it’s preserved.\nIf it matches more than 1 row in y, it’s duplicated once for each match.\n\nIn principle, this means that there’s no guaranteed correspondence between the rows in the output and the rows in x, but in practice, this rarely causes problems. There is, however, one particularly dangerous case which can cause a combinatorial explosion of rows. Imagine joining the following two tables:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhile the first row in df1 only matches one row in df2, the second and third rows both match two rows. This is sometimes called a many-to-many join, and will cause dplyr to emit a warning:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you are doing this deliberately, you can set relationship = \"many-to-many\", as the warning suggests.\n\n19.4.2 Filtering joins\nThe number of matches also determines the behavior of the filtering joins. The semi-join keeps rows in x that have one or more matches in y, as in Figure 19.10. The anti-join keeps rows in x that match zero rows in y, as in Figure 19.11. In both cases, only the existence of a match is important; it doesn’t matter how many times it matches. This means that filtering joins never duplicate rows like mutating joins do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.10: In a semi-join it only matters that there is a match; otherwise values in y don’t affect the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.11: An anti-join is the inverse of a semi-join, dropping rows from x that have a match in y.",

    "section": "\n19.5 Non-equi joins",
    "text": "19.5 Non-equi joins\nSo far you’ve only seen equi joins, joins where the rows match if the x key equals the y key. Now we’re going to relax that restriction and discuss other ways of determining if a pair of rows match.\nBut before we can do that, we need to revisit a simplification we made above. In equi joins the x keys and y are always equal, so we only need to show one in the output. We can request that dplyr keep both keys with keep = TRUE, leading to the code below and the re-drawn inner_join() in Figure 19.12.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.12: An inner join showing both x and y keys in the output.\n\n\n\n\nWhen we move away from equi joins we’ll always show the keys, because the key values will often be different. For example, instead of matching only when the x$key and y$key are equal, we could match whenever the x$key is greater than or equal to the y$key, leading to Figure 19.13. dplyr’s join functions understand this distinction equi and non-equi joins so will always show both keys when you perform a non-equi join.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.13: A non-equi join where the x key must be greater than or equal to the y key. Many rows generate multiple matches.\n\n\n\n\nNon-equi join isn’t a particularly useful term because it only tells you what the join is not, not what it is. dplyr helps by identifying four particularly useful types of non-equi join:\n\n\nCross joins match every pair of rows.\n\nInequality joins use &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, and &gt;= instead of ==.\n\nRolling joins are similar to inequality joins but only find the closest match.\n\nOverlap joins are a special type of inequality join designed to work with ranges.\n\nEach of these is described in more detail in the following sections.\n\n19.5.1 Cross joins\nA cross join matches everything, as in Figure 19.14, generating the Cartesian product of rows. This means the output will have nrow(x) * nrow(y) rows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.14: A cross join matches each row in x with every row in y.\n\n\n\n\nCross joins are useful when generating permutations. For example, the code below generates every possible pair of names. Since we’re joining df to itself, this is sometimes called a self-join. Cross joins use a different join function because there’s no distinction between inner/left/right/full when you’re matching every row.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n19.5.2 Inequality joins\nInequality joins use &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;=, or &gt; to restrict the set of possible matches, as in Figure 19.13 and Figure 19.15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.15: An inequality join where x is joined to y on rows where the key of x is less than the key of y. This makes a triangular shape in the top-left corner.\n\n\n\n\nInequality joins are extremely general, so general that it’s hard to come up with meaningful specific use cases. One small useful technique is to use them to restrict the cross join so that instead of generating all permutations, we generate all combinations:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n19.5.3 Rolling joins\nRolling joins are a special type of inequality join where instead of getting every row that satisfies the inequality, you get just the closest row, as in Figure 19.16. You can turn any inequality join into a rolling join by adding closest(). For example join_by(closest(x &lt;= y)) matches the smallest y that’s greater than or equal to x, and join_by(closest(x &gt; y)) matches the biggest y that’s less than x.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19.16: A rolling join is similar to a greater-than-or-equal inequality join but only matches the first value.\n\n\n\n\nRolling joins are particularly useful when you have two tables of dates that don’t perfectly line up and you want to find (e.g.) the closest date in table 1 that comes before (or after) some date in table 2.\nFor example, imagine that you’re in charge of the party planning commission for your office. Your company is rather cheap so instead of having individual parties, you only have a party once each quarter. The rules for determining when a party will be held are a little complex: parties are always on a Monday, you skip the first week of January since a lot of people are on holiday, and the first Monday of Q3 2022 is July 4, so that has to be pushed back a week. That leads to the following party days:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow imagine that you have a table of employee birthdays:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnd for each employee we want to find the first party date that comes after (or on) their birthday. We can express that with a rolling join:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere is, however, one problem with this approach: the folks with birthdays before January 10 don’t get a party:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo resolve that issue we’ll need to tackle the problem a different way, with overlap joins.\n\n19.5.4 Overlap joins\nOverlap joins provide three helpers that use inequality joins to make it easier to work with intervals:\n\n\nbetween(x, y_lower, y_upper) is short for x &gt;= y_lower, x &lt;= y_upper.\n\nwithin(x_lower, x_upper, y_lower, y_upper) is short for x_lower &gt;= y_lower, x_upper &lt;= y_upper.\n\noverlaps(x_lower, x_upper, y_lower, y_upper) is short for x_lower &lt;= y_upper, x_upper &gt;= y_lower.\n\nLet’s continue the birthday example to see how you might use them. There’s one problem with the strategy we used above: there’s no party preceding the birthdays Jan 1-9. So it might be better to be explicit about the date ranges that each party spans, and make a special case for those early birthdays:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHadley is hopelessly bad at data entry so he also wanted to check that the party periods don’t overlap. One way to do this is by using a self-join to check if any start-end interval overlap with another:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOoops, there is an overlap, so let’s fix that problem and continue:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow we can match each employee to their party. This is a good place to use unmatched = \"error\" because we want to quickly find out if any employees didn’t get assigned a party.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n19.5.5 Exercises\n\n\nCan you explain what’s happening with the keys in this equi join? Why are they different?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nWhen finding if any party period overlapped with another party period we used q &lt; q in the join_by()?

This spreadsheet can be downloaded an Excel file from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V1nPp1tzOuutXFLb3G9Eyxi3qxeEhnOXUzL5_BcCQ0w/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.1: Spreadsheet called students.xlsx in Excel.\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument to read_excel() is the path to the file to read.\n\nstudents &lt;- read_excel(\"data/students.xlsx\")\n\nread_excel() will read the file in as a tibble.\n\nstudents\n#&gt; # A tibble: 6 × 5\n#&gt;   `Student ID` `Full Name`      favourite.food     mealPlan            AGE  \n#&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;\n#&gt; 1            1 Sunil Huffmann   Strawberry yoghurt Lunch only          4    \n#&gt; 2            2 Barclay Lynn     French fries       Lunch only          5    \n#&gt; 3            3 Jayendra Lyne    N/A                Breakfast and lunch 7    \n#&gt; 4            4 Leon Rossini     Anchovies          Lunch only          &lt;NA&gt; \n#&gt; 5            5 Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza              Breakfast and lunch five \n#&gt; 6            6 Güvenç Attila    Ice cream          Lunch only          6\n\nWe have six students in the data and five variables on each student. However there are a few things we might want to address in this dataset:\n\n\nThe column names are all over the place. You can provide column names that follow a consistent format; we recommend snake_case using the col_names argument.\n\nread_excel(\n  \"data/students.xlsx\",\n  col_names = c(\"student_id\", \"full_name\", \"favourite_food\", \"meal_plan\", \"age\")\n)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 7 × 5\n#&gt;   student_id full_name        favourite_food     meal_plan           age  \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;\n#&gt; 1 Student ID Full Name        favourite.food     mealPlan            AGE  \n#&gt; 2 1          Sunil Huffmann   Strawberry yoghurt Lunch only          4    \n#&gt; 3 2          Barclay Lynn     French fries       Lunch only          5    \n#&gt; 4 3          Jayendra Lyne    N/A                Breakfast and lunch 7    \n#&gt; 5 4          Leon Rossini     Anchovies          Lunch only          &lt;NA&gt; \n#&gt; 6 5          Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza              Breakfast and lunch five \n#&gt; 7 6          Güvenç Attila    Ice cream          Lunch only          6\n\nUnfortunately, this didn’t quite do the trick. We now have the variable names we want, but what was previously the header row now shows up as the first observation in the data. You can explicitly skip that row using the skip argument.\n\nread_excel(\n  \"data/students.xlsx\",\n  col_names = c(\"student_id\", \"full_name\", \"favourite_food\", \"meal_plan\", \"age\"),\n  skip = 1\n)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 6 × 5\n#&gt;   student_id full_name        favourite_food     meal_plan           age  \n#&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;\n#&gt; 1          1 Sunil Huffmann   Strawberry yoghurt Lunch only          4    \n#&gt; 2          2 Barclay Lynn     French fries       Lunch only          5    \n#&gt; 3          3 Jayendra Lyne    N/A                Breakfast and lunch 7    \n#&gt; 4          4 Leon Rossini     Anchovies          Lunch only          &lt;NA&gt; \n#&gt; 5          5 Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza              Breakfast and lunch five \n#&gt; 6          6 Güvenç Attila    Ice cream          Lunch only          6\n\n\n\nIn the favourite_food column, one of the observations is N/A, which stands for “not available” but it’s currently not recognized as an NA (note the contrast between this N/A and the age of the fourth student in the list). You can specify which character strings should be recognized as NAs with the na argument. By default, only \"\" (empty string, or, in the case of reading from a spreadsheet, an empty cell or a cell with the formula =NA()) is recognized as an NA.\n\nread_excel(\n  \"data/students.xlsx\",\n  col_names = c(\"student_id\", \"full_name\", \"favourite_food\", \"meal_plan\", \"age\"),\n  skip = 1,\n  na = c(\"\", \"N/A\")\n)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 6 × 5\n#&gt;   student_id full_name        favourite_food     meal_plan           age  \n#&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;\n#&gt; 1          1 Sunil Huffmann   Strawberry yoghurt Lunch only          4    \n#&gt; 2          2 Barclay Lynn     French fries       Lunch only          5    \n#&gt; 3          3 Jayendra Lyne    &lt;NA&gt;               Breakfast and lunch 7    \n#&gt; 4          4 Leon Rossini     Anchovies          Lunch only          &lt;NA&gt; \n#&gt; 5          5 Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza              Breakfast and lunch five \n#&gt; 6          6 Güvenç Attila    Ice cream          Lunch only          6\n\n\n\nOne other remaining issue is that age is read in as a character variable, but it really should be numeric. Just like with read_csv() and friends for reading data from flat files, you can supply a col_types argument to read_excel() and specify the column types for the variables you read in. The syntax is a bit different, though. Your options are \"skip\", \"guess\", \"logical\", \"numeric\", \"date\", \"text\" or \"list\".\n\nread_excel(\n  \"data/students.xlsx\",\n  col_names = c(\"student_id\", \"full_name\", \"favourite_food\", \"meal_plan\", \"age\"),\n  skip = 1,\n  na = c(\"\", \"N/A\"),\n  col_types = c(\"numeric\", \"text\", \"text\", \"text\", \"numeric\")\n)\n#&gt; Warning: Expecting numeric in E6 / R6C5: got 'five'\n#&gt; # A tibble: 6 × 5\n#&gt;   student_id full_name        favourite_food     meal_plan             age\n#&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1          1 Sunil Huffmann   Strawberry yoghurt Lunch only              4\n#&gt; 2          2 Barclay Lynn     French fries       Lunch only              5\n#&gt; 3          3 Jayendra Lyne    &lt;NA&gt;               Breakfast and lunch     7\n#&gt; 4          4 Leon Rossini     Anchovies          Lunch only             NA\n#&gt; 5          5 Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza              Breakfast and lunch    NA\n#&gt; 6          6 Güvenç Attila    Ice cream          Lunch only              6\n\nHowever, this didn’t quite produce the desired result either. By specifying that age should be numeric, we have turned the one cell with the non-numeric entry (which had the value five) into an NA. In this case, we should read age in as \"text\" and then make the change once the data is loaded in R.\n\nstudents &lt;- read_excel(\n  \"data/students.xlsx\",\n  col_names = c(\"student_id\", \"full_name\", \"favourite_food\", \"meal_plan\", \"age\"),\n  skip = 1,\n  na = c(\"\", \"N/A\"),\n  col_types = c(\"numeric\", \"text\", \"text\", \"text\", \"text\")\n)\n\nstudents &lt;- students |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    age = if_else(age == \"five\", \"5\", age),\n    age = parse_number(age)\n  )\n\nstudents\n#&gt; # A tibble: 6 × 5\n#&gt;   student_id full_name        favourite_food     meal_plan             age\n#&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1          1 Sunil Huffmann   Strawberry yoghurt Lunch only              4\n#&gt; 2          2 Barclay Lynn     French fries       Lunch only              5\n#&gt; 3          3 Jayendra Lyne    &lt;NA&gt;               Breakfast and lunch     7\n#&gt; 4          4 Leon Rossini     Anchovies          Lunch only             NA\n#&gt; 5          5 Chidiegwu Dunkel Pizza              Breakfast and lunch     5\n#&gt; 6          6 Güvenç Attila    Ice cream          Lunch only              6\n\n\n\nIt took us multiple steps and trial-and-error to load the data in exactly the format we want, and this is not unexpected. Data science is an iterative process, and the process of iteration can be even more tedious when reading data in from spreadsheets compared to other plain text, rectangular data files because humans tend to input data into spreadsheets and use them not just for data storage but also for sharing and communication.\nThere is no way to know exactly what the data will look like until you load it and take a look at it. Well, there is one way, actually. You can open the file in Excel and take a peek. If you’re going to do so, we recommend making a copy of the Excel file to open and browse interactively while leaving the original data file untouched and reading into R from the untouched file. This will ensure you don’t accidentally overwrite anything in the spreadsheet while inspecting it. You should also not be afraid of doing what we did here: load the data, take a peek, make adjustments to your code, load it again, and repeat until you’re happy with the result.\n\n20.2.4 Reading worksheets\nAn important feature that distinguishes spreadsheets from flat files is the notion of multiple sheets, called worksheets. Figure 20.2 shows an Excel spreadsheet with multiple worksheets. The data come from the palmerpenguins package, and you can download this spreadsheet as an Excel file from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aFu8lnD_g0yjF5O-K6SFgSEWiHPpgvFCF0NY9D6LXnY/. Each worksheet contains information on penguins from a different island where data were collected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.2: Spreadsheet called penguins.xlsx in Excel containing three worksheets.\n\n\n\n\nYou can read a single worksheet from a spreadsheet with the sheet argument in read_excel(). The default, which we’ve been relying on up until now, is the first sheet.\n\nread_excel(\"data/penguins.xlsx\", sheet = \"Torgersen Island\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 52 × 8\n#&gt;   species island    bill_length_mm     bill_depth_mm      flipper_length_mm\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;            \n#&gt; 1 Adelie  Torgersen 39.1               18.7               181              \n#&gt; 2 Adelie  Torgersen 39.5               17.399999999999999 186              \n#&gt; 3 Adelie  Torgersen 40.299999999999997 18                 195              \n#&gt; 4 Adelie  Torgersen NA                 NA                 NA               \n#&gt; 5 Adelie  Torgersen 36.700000000000003 19.3               193              \n#&gt; 6 Adelie  Torgersen 39.299999999999997 20.6               190              \n#&gt; # ℹ 46 more rows\n#&gt; # ℹ 3 more variables: body_mass_g &lt;chr&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt;\n\nSome variables that appear to contain numerical data are read in as characters due to the character string \"NA\" not being recognized as a true NA.\n\npenguins_torgersen &lt;- read_excel(\"data/penguins.xlsx\", sheet = \"Torgersen Island\", na = \"NA\")\n\npenguins_torgersen\n#&gt; # A tibble: 52 × 8\n#&gt;   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181\n#&gt; 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186\n#&gt; 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195\n#&gt; 4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA                  NA\n#&gt; 5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193\n#&gt; 6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190\n#&gt; # ℹ 46 more rows\n#&gt; # ℹ 3 more variables: body_mass_g &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt;\n\nAlternatively, you can use excel_sheets() to get information on all worksheets in an Excel spreadsheet, and then read the one(s) you’re interested in.\n\nexcel_sheets(\"data/penguins.xlsx\")\n#&gt; [1] \"Torgersen Island\" \"Biscoe Island\"    \"Dream Island\"\n\nOnce you know the names of the worksheets, you can read them in individually with read_excel().\n\npenguins_biscoe &lt;- read_excel(\"data/penguins.xlsx\", sheet = \"Biscoe Island\", na = \"NA\")\npenguins_dream  &lt;- read_excel(\"data/penguins.xlsx\", sheet = \"Dream Island\", na = \"NA\")\n\nIn this case the full penguins dataset is spread across three worksheets in the spreadsheet.

Figure 20.3 shows such a spreadsheet: in the middle of the sheet is what looks like a data frame but there is extraneous text in cells above and below the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.3: Spreadsheet called deaths.xlsx in Excel.\n\n\n\n\nThis spreadsheet is one of the example spreadsheets provided in the readxl package. You can use the readxl_example() function to locate the spreadsheet on your system in the directory where the package is installed. This function returns the path to the spreadsheet, which you can use in read_excel() as usual.\n\ndeaths_path &lt;- readxl_example(\"deaths.xlsx\")\ndeaths &lt;- read_excel(deaths_path)\n#&gt; New names:\n#&gt; • `` -&gt; `...2`\n#&gt; • `` -&gt; `...3`\n#&gt; • `` -&gt; `...4`\n#&gt; • `` -&gt; `...5`\n#&gt; • `` -&gt; `...6`\ndeaths\n#&gt; # A tibble: 18 × 6\n#&gt;   `Lots of people`    ...2       ...3  ...4     ...5          ...6           \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;          \n#&gt; 1 simply cannot resi… &lt;NA&gt;       &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;     &lt;NA&gt;          some notes     \n#&gt; 2 at                  the        top   &lt;NA&gt;     of            their spreadsh…\n#&gt; 3 or                  merging    &lt;NA&gt;  &lt;NA&gt;     &lt;NA&gt;          cells          \n#&gt; 4 Name                Profession Age   Has kids Date of birth Date of death  \n#&gt; 5 David Bowie         musician   69    TRUE     17175         42379          \n#&gt; 6 Carrie Fisher       actor      60    TRUE     20749         42731          \n#&gt; # ℹ 12 more rows\n\nThe top three rows and the bottom four rows are not part of the data frame. It’s possible to eliminate these extraneous rows using the skip and n_max arguments, but we recommend using cell ranges. In Excel, the top left cell is A1. As you move across columns to the right, the cell label moves down the alphabet, i.e. B1, C1, etc. And as you move down a column, the number in the cell label increases, i.e. A2, A3, etc.\nHere the data we want to read in starts in cell A5 and ends in cell F15. In spreadsheet notation, this is A5:F15, which we supply to the range argument:\n\nread_excel(deaths_path, range = \"A5:F15\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 10 × 6\n#&gt;   Name          Profession   Age `Has kids` `Date of birth`    \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;      &lt;dttm&gt;             \n#&gt; 1 David Bowie   musician      69 TRUE       1947-01-08 00:00:00\n#&gt; 2 Carrie Fisher actor         60 TRUE       1956-10-21 00:00:00\n#&gt; 3 Chuck Berry   musician      90 TRUE       1926-10-18 00:00:00\n#&gt; 4 Bill Paxton   actor         61 TRUE       1955-05-17 00:00:00\n#&gt; 5 Prince        musician      57 TRUE       1958-06-07 00:00:00\n#&gt; 6 Alan Rickman  actor         69 FALSE      1946-02-21 00:00:00\n#&gt; # ℹ 4 more rows\n#&gt; # ℹ 1 more variable: `Date of death` &lt;dttm&gt;\n\n\n20.2.6 Data types\nIn CSV files, all values are strings. This is not particularly true to the data, but it is simple: everything is a string.\nThe underlying data in Excel spreadsheets is more complex. A cell can be one of four things:\n\nA boolean, like TRUE, FALSE, or NA.\nA number, like “10” or “10.5”.\nA datetime, which can also include time like “11/1/21” or “11/1/21 3:00 PM”.\nA text string, like “ten”.\n\nWhen working with spreadsheet data, it’s important to keep in mind that the underlying data can be very different than what you see in the cell. For example, Excel has no notion of an integer. All numbers are stored as floating points, but you can choose to display the data with a customizable number of decimal points. Similarly, dates are actually stored as numbers, specifically the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. You can customize how you display the date by applying formatting in Excel. Confusingly, it’s also possible to have something that looks like a number but is actually a string (e.g., type '10 into a cell in Excel).\nThese differences between how the underlying data are stored vs. how they’re displayed can cause surprises when the data are loaded into R. By default readxl will guess the data type in a given column. A recommended workflow is to let readxl guess the column types, confirm that you’re happy with the guessed column types, and if not, go back and re-import specifying col_types as shown in Section 20.2.3.\nAnother challenge is when you have a column in your Excel spreadsheet that has a mix of these types, e.g., some cells are numeric, others text, others dates. When importing the data into R readxl has to make some decisions. In these cases you can set the type for this column to \"list\", which will load the column as a list of length 1 vectors, where the type of each element of the vector is guessed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes data is stored in more exotic ways, like the color of the cell background, or whether or not the text is bold. In such cases, you might find the tidyxl package useful. See https://nacnudus.github.io/spreadsheet-munging-strategies/ for more on strategies for working with non-tabular data from Excel.\n\n\n\n\n20.2.7 Writing to Excel\nLet’s create a small data frame that we can then write out. Note that item is a factor and quantity is an integer.\n\nbake_sale &lt;- tibble(\n  item     = factor(c(\"brownie\", \"cupcake\", \"cookie\")),\n  quantity = c(10, 5, 8)\n)\n\nbake_sale\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   item    quantity\n#&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1 brownie       10\n#&gt; 2 cupcake        5\n#&gt; 3 cookie         8\n\nYou can write data back to disk as an Excel file using the write_xlsx() from the writexl package:\n\nwrite_xlsx(bake_sale, path = \"data/bake-sale.xlsx\")\n\nFigure 20.4 shows what the data looks like in Excel. Note that column names are included and bolded. These can be turned off by setting col_names and format_headers arguments to FALSE.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.4: Spreadsheet called bake_sale.xlsx in Excel.\n\n\n\n\nJust like reading from a CSV, information on data type is lost when we read the data back in. This makes Excel files unreliable for caching interim results as well. For alternatives, see Section 7.5.\n\nread_excel(\"data/bake-sale.xlsx\")\n#&gt; # A tibble: 3 × 2\n#&gt;   item    quantity\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1 brownie       10\n#&gt; 2 cupcake        5\n#&gt; 3 cookie         8\n\n\n20.2.8 Formatted output\nThe writexl package is a light-weight solution for writing a simple Excel spreadsheet, but if you’re interested in additional features like writing to sheets within a spreadsheet and styling, you will want to use the openxlsx package. We won’t go into the details of using this package here, but we recommend reading https://ycphs.github.io/openxlsx/articles/Formatting.html for an extensive discussion on further formatting functionality for data written from R to Excel with openxlsx.\nNote that this package is not part of the tidyverse so the functions and workflows may feel unfamiliar. For example, function names are camelCase, multiple functions can’t be composed in pipelines, and arguments are in a different order than they tend to be in the tidyverse. However, this is ok. As your R learning and usage expands outside of this book you will encounter lots of different styles used in various R packages that you might use to accomplish specific goals in R. A good way of familiarizing yourself with the coding style used in a new package is to run the examples provided in function documentation to get a feel for the syntax and the output formats as well as reading any vignettes that might come with the package.\n\n20.2.9 Exercises\n\n\nIn an Excel file, create the following dataset and save it as survey.xlsx. Alternatively, you can download it as an Excel file from here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, read it into R, with survey_id as a character variable and n_pets as a numerical variable.\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 6 × 2\n#&gt;   survey_id n_pets\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1 1              0\n#&gt; 2 2              1\n#&gt; 3 3             NA\n#&gt; 4 4              2\n#&gt; 5 5              2\n#&gt; 6 6             NA\n\n\n\nIn another Excel file, create the following dataset and save it as roster.xlsx. Alternatively, you can download it as an Excel file from here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, read it into R. The resulting data frame should be called roster and should look like the following.\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 12 × 3\n#&gt;    group subgroup    id\n#&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt;  1     1 A            1\n#&gt;  2     1 A            2\n#&gt;  3     1 A            3\n#&gt;  4     1 B            4\n#&gt;  5     1 B            5\n#&gt;  6     1 B            6\n#&gt;  7     1 B            7\n#&gt;  8     2 A            8\n#&gt;  9     2 A            9\n#&gt; 10     2 B           10\n#&gt; 11     2 B           11\n#&gt; 12     2 B           12\n\n\n\nIn a new Excel file, create the following dataset and save it as sales.xlsx. Alternatively, you can download it as an Excel file from here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na. Read sales.xlsx in and save as sales. The data frame should look like the following, with id and n as column names and with 9 rows.\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 9 × 2\n#&gt;   id      n    \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;\n#&gt; 1 Brand 1 n    \n#&gt; 2 1234    8    \n#&gt; 3 8721    2    \n#&gt; 4 1822    3    \n#&gt; 5 Brand 2 n    \n#&gt; 6 3333    1    \n#&gt; 7 2156    3    \n#&gt; 8 3987    6    \n#&gt; 9 3216    5\n\nb. Modify sales further to get it into the following tidy format with three columns (brand, id, and n) and 7 rows of data. Note that id and n are numeric, brand is a character variable.\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 7 × 3\n#&gt;   brand      id     n\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1 Brand 1  1234     8\n#&gt; 2 Brand 1  8721     2\n#&gt; 3 Brand 1  1822     3\n#&gt; 4 Brand 2  3333     1\n#&gt; 5 Brand 2  2156     3\n#&gt; 6 Brand 2  3987     6\n#&gt; 7 Brand 2  3216     5\n\n\nRecreate the bake_sale data frame, write it out to an Excel file using the write.xlsx() function from the openxlsx package.\nIn Chapter 7 you learned about the janitor::clean_names() function to turn column names into snake case. Read the students.xlsx file that we introduced earlier in this section and use this function to “clean” the column names.\nWhat happens if you try to read in a file with .xlsx extension with read_xls()?",

    "text": "20.3 Google Sheets\nGoogle Sheets is another widely used spreadsheet program. It’s free and web-based. Just like with Excel, in Google Sheets data are organized in worksheets (also called sheets) inside of spreadsheet files.\n\n20.3.1 Prerequisites\nThis section will also focus on spreadsheets, but this time you’ll be loading data from a Google Sheet with the googlesheets4 package. This package is non-core tidyverse as well, you need to load it explicitly.\n\nlibrary(googlesheets4)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nA quick note about the name of the package: googlesheets4 uses v4 of the Sheets API v4 to provide an R interface to Google Sheets, hence the name.\n\n20.3.2 Getting started\nThe main function of the googlesheets4 package is read_sheet(), which reads a Google Sheet from a URL or a file id. This function also goes by the name range_read().\nYou can also create a brand new sheet with gs4_create() or write to an existing sheet with sheet_write() and friends.\nIn this section we’ll work with the same datasets as the ones in the Excel section to highlight similarities and differences between workflows for reading data from Excel and Google Sheets. readxl and googlesheets4 packages are both designed to mimic the functionality of the readr package, which provides the read_csv() function you’ve seen in Chapter 7. Therefore, many of the tasks can be accomplished with simply swapping out read_excel() for read_sheet(). However you’ll also see that Excel and Google Sheets don’t behave in exactly the same way, therefore other tasks may require further updates to the function calls.\n\n20.3.3 Reading Google Sheets\nFigure 20.5 shows what the spreadsheet we’re going to read into R looks like in Google Sheets. This is the same dataset as in Figure 20.1, except it’s stored in a Google Sheet instead of Excel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20.5: Google Sheet called students in a browser window.\n\n\n\n\nThe first argument to read_sheet() is the URL of the file to read, and it returns a tibble:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V1nPp1tzOuutXFLb3G9Eyxi3qxeEhnOXUzL5_BcCQ0w.

Note that we’re also using the gs4_example() function below to locate an example Google Sheet that comes with the googlesheets4 package.\n\ndeaths_url &lt;- gs4_example(\"deaths\")\ndeaths &lt;- read_sheet(deaths_url, range = \"A5:F15\")\n#&gt; ✔ Reading from deaths.\n#&gt; ✔ Range A5:F15.\ndeaths\n#&gt; # A tibble: 10 × 6\n#&gt;   Name          Profession   Age `Has kids` `Date of birth`    \n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;      &lt;dttm&gt;             \n#&gt; 1 David Bowie   musician      69 TRUE       1947-01-08 00:00:00\n#&gt; 2 Carrie Fisher actor         60 TRUE       1956-10-21 00:00:00\n#&gt; 3 Chuck Berry   musician      90 TRUE       1926-10-18 00:00:00\n#&gt; 4 Bill Paxton   actor         61 TRUE       1955-05-17 00:00:00\n#&gt; 5 Prince        musician      57 TRUE       1958-06-07 00:00:00\n#&gt; 6 Alan Rickman  actor         69 FALSE      1946-02-21 00:00:00\n#&gt; # ℹ 4 more rows\n#&gt; # ℹ 1 more variable: `Date of death` &lt;dttm&gt;\n\n\n20.3.4 Writing to Google Sheets\nYou can write from R to Google Sheets with write_sheet(). The first argument is the data frame to write, and the second argument is the name (or other identifier) of the Google Sheet to write to:\n\nwrite_sheet(bake_sale, ss = \"bake-sale\")\n\nIf you’d like to write your data to a specific (work)sheet inside a Google Sheet, you can specify that with the sheet argument as well.\n\nwrite_sheet(bake_sale, ss = \"bake-sale\", sheet = \"Sales\")\n\n\n20.3.5 Authentication\nWhile you can read from a public Google Sheet without authenticating with your Google account and with gs4_deauth(), reading a private sheet or writing to a sheet requires authentication so that googlesheets4 can view and manage your Google Sheets.\nWhen you attempt to read in a sheet that requires authentication, googlesheets4 will direct you to a web browser with a prompt to sign in to your Google account and grant permission to operate on your behalf with Google Sheets. However, if you want to specify a specific Google account, authentication scope, etc. you can do so with gs4_auth(), e.g., gs4_auth(email = \"mine@example.com\"), which will force the use of a token associated with a specific email. For further authentication details, we recommend reading the documentation googlesheets4 auth vignette: https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/articles/auth.html.\n\n20.3.6 Exercises\n\nRead the students dataset from earlier in the chapter from Excel and also from Google Sheets, with no additional arguments supplied to the read_excel() and read_sheet() functions. Are the resulting data frames in R exactly the same? If not, how are they different?\nRead the Google Sheet titled survey from https://pos.it/r4ds-survey, with survey_id as a character variable and n_pets as a numerical variable.\n\nRead the Google Sheet titled roster from https://pos.it/r4ds-roster. The resulting data frame should be called roster and should look like the following.\n\n#&gt; # A tibble: 12 × 3\n#&gt;    group subgroup    id\n#&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt;  1     1 A            1\n#&gt;  2     1 A            2\n#&gt;  3     1 A            3\n#&gt;  4     1 B            4\n#&gt;  5     1 B            5\n#&gt;  6     1 B            6\n#&gt;  7     1 B            7\n#&gt;  8     2 A            8\n#&gt;  9     2 A            9\n#&gt; 10     2 B           10\n#&gt; 11     2 B           11\n#&gt; 12     2 B           12",

Sometimes you can ask someone to download a snapshot into a .csv for you, but this gets painful quickly: every time you need to make a change you’ll have to communicate with another human. You want to be able to reach into the database directly to get the data you need, when you need it.\nIn this chapter, you’ll first learn the basics of the DBI package: how to use it to connect to a database and then retrieve data with a SQL1 query. SQL, short for structured query language, is the lingua franca of databases, and is an important language for all data scientists to learn. That said, we’re not going to start with SQL, but instead we’ll teach you dbplyr, which can translate your dplyr code to the SQL. We’ll use that as a way to teach you some of the most important features of SQL. You won’t become a SQL master by the end of the chapter, but you will be able to identify the most important components and understand what they do.",

    "text": "21.2 Database basics\nAt the simplest level, you can think about a database as a collection of data frames, called tables in database terminology. Like a data frame, a database table is a collection of named columns, where every value in the column is the same type. There are three high level differences between data frames and database tables:\n\nDatabase tables are stored on disk and can be arbitrarily large. Data frames are stored in memory, and are fundamentally limited (although that limit is still plenty large for many problems).\nDatabase tables almost always have indexes. Much like the index of a book, a database index makes it possible to quickly find rows of interest without having to look at every single row. Data frames and tibbles don’t have indexes, but data.tables do, which is one of the reasons that they’re so fast.\nMost classical databases are optimized for rapidly collecting data, not analyzing existing data. These databases are called row-oriented because the data is stored row-by-row, rather than column-by-column like R. More recently, there’s been much development of column-oriented databases that make analyzing the existing data much faster.\n\nDatabases are run by database management systems (DBMS’s for short), which come in three basic forms:\n\n\nClient-server DBMS’s run on a powerful central server, which you connect from your computer (the client). They are great for sharing data with multiple people in an organization. Popular client-server DBMS’s include PostgreSQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, and Oracle.\n\nCloud DBMS’s, like Snowflake, Amazon’s RedShift, and Google’s BigQuery, are similar to client server DBMS’s, but they run in the cloud. This means that they can easily handle extremely large datasets and can automatically provide more compute resources as needed.\n\nIn-process DBMS’s, like SQLite or duckdb, run entirely on your computer. They’re great for working with large datasets where you’re the primary user.",

    "section": "\n21.3 Connecting to a database",
    "text": "21.3 Connecting to a database\nTo connect to the database from R, you’ll use a pair of packages:\n\nYou’ll always use DBI (database interface) because it provides a set of generic functions that connect to the database, upload data, run SQL queries, etc.\nYou’ll also use a package tailored for the DBMS you’re connecting to. This package translates the generic DBI commands into the specifics needed for a given DBMS. There’s usually one package for each DBMS, e.g. RPostgres for PostgreSQL and RMariaDB for MySQL.\n\nIf you can’t find a specific package for your DBMS, you can usually use the odbc package instead. This uses the ODBC protocol supported by many DBMS. odbc requires a little more setup because you’ll also need to install an ODBC driver and tell the odbc package where to find it.\nConcretely, you create a database connection using DBI::dbConnect(). The first argument selects the DBMS2, then the second and subsequent arguments describe how to connect to it (i.e. where it lives and the credentials that you need to access it). The following code shows a couple of typical examples:\n\ncon &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(\n  RMariaDB::MariaDB(), \n  username = \"foo\"\n)\ncon &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(\n  RPostgres::Postgres(), \n  hostname = \"databases.mycompany.com\", \n  port = 1234\n)\n\nThe precise details of the connection vary a lot from DBMS to DBMS so unfortunately we can’t cover all the details here. This means you’ll need to do a little research on your own. Typically you can ask the other data scientists in your team or talk to your DBA (database administrator). The initial setup will often take a little fiddling (and maybe some googling) to get it right, but you’ll generally only need to do it once.\n\n21.3.1 In this book\nSetting up a client-server or cloud DBMS would be a pain for this book, so we’ll instead use an in-process DBMS that lives entirely in an R package: duckdb. Thanks to the magic of DBI, the only difference between using duckdb and any other DBMS is how you’ll connect to the database. This makes it great to teach with because you can easily run this code as well as easily take what you learn and apply it elsewhere.\nConnecting to duckdb is particularly simple because the defaults create a temporary database that is deleted when you quit R. That’s great for learning because it guarantees that you’ll start from a clean slate every time you restart R:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nduckdb is a high-performance database that’s designed very much for the needs of a data scientist. We use it here because it’s very easy to get started with, but it’s also capable of handling gigabytes of data with great speed. If you want to use duckdb for a real data analysis project, you’ll also need to supply the dbdir argument to make a persistent database and tell duckdb where to save it. Assuming you’re using a project (Chapter 6), it’s reasonable to store it in the duckdb directory of the current project:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n21.3.2 Load some data\nSince this is a new database, we need to start by adding some data. Here we’ll add mpg and diamonds datasets from ggplot2 using DBI::dbWriteTable(). The simplest usage of dbWriteTable() needs three arguments: a database connection, the name of the table to create in the database, and a data frame of data.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you’re using duckdb in a real project, we highly recommend learning about duckdb_read_csv() and duckdb_register_arrow(). These give you powerful and performant ways to quickly load data directly into duckdb, without having to first load it into R. We’ll also show off a useful technique for loading multiple files into a database in Section 26.4.1.\n\n21.3.3 DBI basics\nYou can check that the data is loaded correctly by using a couple of other DBI functions: dbListTables() lists all tables in the database3 and dbReadTable() retrieves the contents of a table.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\ndbReadTable() returns a data.frame so we use as_tibble() to convert it into a tibble so that it prints nicely.\nIf you already know SQL, you can use dbGetQuery() to get the results of running a query on the database:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you’ve never seen SQL before, don’t worry! You’ll learn more about it shortly. But if you read it carefully, you might guess that it selects five columns of the diamonds dataset and all the rows where price is greater than 15,000.",

In this, dbplyr translates to SQL; other backends include dtplyr which translates to data.table, and multidplyr which executes your code on multiple cores.\nTo use dbplyr, you must first use tbl() to create an object that represents a database table:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two other common ways to interact with a database. First, many corporate databases are very large so you need some hierarchy to keep all the tables organized. In that case you might need to supply a schema, or a catalog and a schema, in order to pick the table you’re interested in:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOther times you might want to use your own SQL query as a starting point:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nThis object is lazy; when you use dplyr verbs on it, dplyr doesn’t do any work: it just records the sequence of operations that you want to perform and only performs them when needed. For example, take the following pipeline:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can tell this object represents a database query because it prints the DBMS name at the top, and while it tells you the number of columns, it typically doesn’t know the number of rows. This is because finding the total number of rows usually requires executing the complete query, something we’re trying to avoid.\nYou can see the SQL code generated by the dplyr function show_query(). If you know dplyr, this is a great way to learn SQL! Write some dplyr code, get dbplyr to translate it to SQL, and then try to figure out how the two languages match up.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo get all the data back into R, you call collect(). Behind the scenes, this generates the SQL, calls dbGetQuery() to get the data, then turns the result into a tibble:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTypically, you’ll use dbplyr to select the data you want from the database, performing basic filtering and aggregation using the translations described below. Then, once you’re ready to analyse the data with functions that are unique to R, you’ll collect() the data to get an in-memory tibble, and continue your work with pure R code.",

    "text": "21.5 SQL\nThe rest of the chapter will teach you a little SQL through the lens of dbplyr. It’s a rather non-traditional introduction to SQL but we hope it will get you quickly up to speed with the basics. Luckily, if you understand dplyr you’re in a great place to quickly pick up SQL because so many of the concepts are the same.\nWe’ll explore the relationship between dplyr and SQL using a couple of old friends from the nycflights13 package: flights and planes. These datasets are easy to get into our learning database because dbplyr comes with a function that copies the tables from nycflights13 to our database:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n21.5.1 SQL basics\nThe top-level components of SQL are called statements. Common statements include CREATE for defining new tables, INSERT for adding data, and SELECT for retrieving data. We will focus on SELECT statements, also called queries, because they are almost exclusively what you’ll use as a data scientist.\nA query is made up of clauses. There are five important clauses: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY. Every query must have the SELECT4 and FROM5 clauses and the simplest query is SELECT * FROM table, which selects all columns from the specified table . This is what dbplyr generates for an unadulterated table :\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWHERE and ORDER BY control which rows are included and how they are ordered:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nGROUP BY converts the query to a summary, causing aggregation to happen:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere are two important differences between dplyr verbs and SELECT clauses:\n\nIn SQL, case doesn’t matter: you can write select, SELECT, or even SeLeCt. In this book we’ll stick with the common convention of writing SQL keywords in uppercase to distinguish them from table or variables names.\nIn SQL, order matters: you must always write the clauses in the order SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY. Confusingly, this order doesn’t match how the clauses actually evaluated which is first FROM, then WHERE, GROUP BY, SELECT, and ORDER BY.\n\nThe following sections explore each clause in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that while SQL is a standard, it is extremely complex and no database follows it exactly. While the main components that we’ll focus on in this book are very similar between DBMS’s, there are many minor variations. Fortunately, dbplyr is designed to handle this problem and generates different translations for different databases. It’s not perfect, but it’s continually improving, and if you hit a problem you can file an issue on GitHub to help us do better.\n\n\n\n\n21.5.2 SELECT\nThe SELECT clause is the workhorse of queries and performs the same job as select(), mutate(), rename(), relocate(), and, as you’ll learn in the next section, summarize().\nselect(), rename(), and relocate() have very direct translations to SELECT as they just affect where a column appears (if at all) along with its name:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis example also shows you how SQL does renaming. In SQL terminology renaming is called aliasing and is done with AS. Note that unlike mutate(), the old name is on the left and the new name is on the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the examples above note that \"year\" and \"type\" are wrapped in double quotes. That’s because these are reserved words in duckdb, so dbplyr quotes them to avoid any potential confusion between column/table names and SQL operators.\nWhen working with other databases you’re likely to see every variable name quoted because only a handful of client packages, like duckdb, know what all the reserved words are, so they quote everything to be safe.\nSELECT \"tailnum\", \"type\", \"manufacturer\", \"model\", \"year\"\nFROM \"planes\"\nSome other database systems use backticks instead of quotes:\nSELECT `tailnum`, `type`, `manufacturer`, `model`, `year`\nFROM `planes`\n\n\n\nThe translations for mutate() are similarly straightforward: each variable becomes a new expression in SELECT:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe’ll come back to the translation of individual components (like /) in Section 21.6.\n\n21.5.3 FROM\nThe FROM clause defines the data source. It’s going to be rather uninteresting for a little while, because we’re just using single tables. You’ll see more complex examples once we hit the join functions.\n\n21.5.4 GROUP BY\ngroup_by() is translated to the GROUP BY6 clause and summarize() is translated to the SELECT clause:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe’ll come back to what’s happening with translation n() and mean() in Section 21.6.\n\n21.5.5 WHERE\nfilter() is translated to the WHERE clause:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere are a few important details to note here:\n\n\n| becomes OR and & becomes AND.\nSQL uses = for comparison, not ==. SQL doesn’t have assignment, so there’s no potential for confusion there.\nSQL uses only '' for strings, not \"\". In SQL, \"\" is used to identify variables, like R’s ``.\n\nAnother useful SQL operator is IN, which is very close to R’s %in%:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSQL uses NULL instead of NA. NULLs behave similarly to NAs. The main difference is that while they’re “infectious” in comparisons and arithmetic, they are silently dropped when summarizing. dbplyr will remind you about this behavior the first time you hit it:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you want to learn more about how NULLs work, you might enjoy “The Three-Valued Logic of SQL” by Markus Winand.\nIn general, you can work with NULLs using the functions you’d use for NAs in R:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis SQL query illustrates one of the drawbacks of dbplyr: while the SQL is correct, it isn’t as simple as you might write by hand. In this case, you could drop the parentheses and use a special operator that’s easier to read:\nWHERE \"dep_delay\" IS NOT NULL\nNote that if you filter() a variable that you created using a summarize, dbplyr will generate a HAVING clause, rather than a WHERE clause. This is a one of the idiosyncrasies of SQL: WHERE is evaluated before SELECT and GROUP BY, so SQL needs another clause that’s evaluated afterwards.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n21.5.6 ORDER BY\nOrdering rows involves a straightforward translation from arrange() to the ORDER BY clause:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotice how desc() is translated to DESC: this is one of the many dplyr functions whose name was directly inspired by SQL.\n\n21.5.7 Subqueries\nSometimes it’s not possible to translate a dplyr pipeline into a single SELECT statement and you need to use a subquery. A subquery is just a query used as a data source in the FROM clause, instead of the usual table.\ndbplyr typically uses subqueries to work around limitations of SQL. For example, expressions in the SELECT clause can’t refer to columns that were just created. That means that the following (silly) dplyr pipeline needs to happen in two steps: the first (inner) query computes year1 and then the second (outer) query can compute year2.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou’ll also see this if you attempted to filter() a variable that you just created. Remember, even though WHERE is written after SELECT, it’s evaluated before it, so we need a subquery in this (silly) example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSometimes dbplyr will create a subquery where it’s not needed because it doesn’t yet know how to optimize that translation. As dbplyr improves over time, these cases will get rarer but will probably never go away.\n\n21.5.8 Joins\nIf you’re familiar with dplyr’s joins, SQL joins are very similar. Here’s a simple example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe main thing to notice here is the syntax: SQL joins use sub-clauses of the FROM clause to bring in additional tables, using ON to define how the tables are related.\ndplyr’s names for these functions are so closely connected to SQL that you can easily guess the equivalent SQL for inner_join(), right_join(), and full_join():\nSELECT flights.*, \"type\", manufacturer, model, engines, seats, speed\nFROM flights\nINNER JOIN planes ON (flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum)\n\nSELECT flights.*, \"type\", manufacturer, model, engines, seats, speed\nFROM flights\nRIGHT JOIN planes ON (flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum)\n\nSELECT flights.*, \"type\", manufacturer, model, engines, seats, speed\nFROM flights\nFULL JOIN planes ON (flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum)\nYou’re likely to need many joins when working with data from a database. That’s because database tables are often stored in a highly normalized form, where each “fact” is stored in a single place and to keep a complete dataset for analysis you need to navigate a complex network of tables connected by primary and foreign keys. If you hit this scenario, the dm package, by Tobias Schieferdecker, Kirill Müller, and Darko Bergant, is a life saver. It can automatically determine the connections between tables using the constraints that DBAs often supply, visualize the connections so you can see what’s going on, and generate the joins you need to connect one table to another.\n\n21.5.9 Other verbs\ndbplyr also translates other verbs like distinct(), slice_*(), and intersect(), and a growing selection of tidyr functions like pivot_longer() and pivot_wider(). The easiest way to see the full set of what’s currently available is to visit the dbplyr website: https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/.\n\n21.5.10 Exercises\n\nWhat is distinct() translated to? How about head()?\n\nExplain what each of the following SQL queries do and try recreate them using dbplyr.\nSELECT * \nFROM flights\nWHERE dep_delay &lt; arr_delay\n\nSELECT *, distance / (air_time / 60) AS speed\nFROM flights",

    "text": "21.6 Function translations\nSo far we’ve focused on the big picture of how dplyr verbs are translated to the clauses of a query. Now we’re going to zoom in a little and talk about the translation of the R functions that work with individual columns, e.g., what happens when you use mean(x) in a summarize()?\nTo help see what’s going on, we’ll use a couple of little helper functions that run a summarize() or mutate() and show the generated SQL. That will make it a little easier to explore a few variations and see how summaries and transformations can differ.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nLet’s dive in with some summaries! Looking at the code below you’ll notice that some summary functions, like mean(), have a relatively simple translation while others, like median(), are much more complex. The complexity is typically higher for operations that are common in statistics but less common in databases.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe translation of summary functions becomes more complicated when you use them inside a mutate() because they have to turn into so-called window functions. In SQL, you turn an ordinary aggregation function into a window function by adding OVER after it:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn SQL, the GROUP BY clause is used exclusively for summaries so here you can see that the grouping has moved from the PARTITION BY argument to OVER.\nWindow functions include all functions that look forward or backwards, like lead() and lag() which look at the “previous” or “next” value respectively:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere it’s important to arrange() the data, because SQL tables have no intrinsic order. In fact, if you don’t use arrange() you might get the rows back in a different order every time! Notice for window functions, the ordering information is repeated: the ORDER BY clause of the main query doesn’t automatically apply to window functions.\nAnother important SQL function is CASE WHEN. It’s used as the translation of if_else() and case_when(), the dplyr function that it directly inspired. Here are a couple of simple examples:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nCASE WHEN is also used for some other functions that don’t have a direct translation from R to SQL. A good example of this is cut():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\ndbplyr also translates common string and date-time manipulation functions, which you can learn about in vignette(\"translation-function\", package = \"dbplyr\"). dbplyr’s translations are certainly not perfect, and there are many R functions that aren’t translated yet, but dbplyr does a surprisingly good job covering the functions that you’ll use most of the time.",

This dataset contains 41,389,465 rows that tell you how many times each book was checked out each month from April 2005 to October 2022.\nThe following code will get you a cached copy of the data. The data is a 9GB CSV file, so it will take some time to download.

    "text": "22.3 Opening a dataset\nLet’s start by taking a look at the data. At 9 GB, this file is large enough that we probably don’t want to load the whole thing into memory. A good rule of thumb is that you usually want at least twice as much memory as the size of the data, and many laptops top out at 16 GB. This means we want to avoid read_csv() and instead use the arrow::open_dataset():\n\nseattle_csv &lt;- open_dataset(\n  sources = \"data/seattle-library-checkouts.csv\", \n  col_types = schema(ISBN = string()),\n  format = \"csv\"\n)\n\nWhat happens when this code is run? open_dataset() will scan a few thousand rows to figure out the structure of the dataset. The ISBN column contains blank values for the first 80,000 rows, so we have to specify the column type to help arrow work out the data structure. Once the data has been scanned by open_dataset(), it records what it’s found and stops; it will only read further rows as you specifically request them. This metadata is what we see if we print seattle_csv:\n\nseattle_csv\n#&gt; FileSystemDataset with 1 csv file\n#&gt; UsageClass: string\n#&gt; CheckoutType: string\n#&gt; MaterialType: string\n#&gt; CheckoutYear: int64\n#&gt; CheckoutMonth: int64\n#&gt; Checkouts: int64\n#&gt; Title: string\n#&gt; ISBN: string\n#&gt; Creator: string\n#&gt; Subjects: string\n#&gt; Publisher: string\n#&gt; PublicationYear: string\n\nThe first line in the output tells you that seattle_csv is stored locally on-disk as a single CSV file; it will only be loaded into memory as needed. The remainder of the output tells you the column type that arrow has imputed for each column.\nWe can see what’s actually in with glimpse(). This reveals that there are ~41 million rows and 12 columns, and shows us a few values.\n\nseattle_csv |&gt; glimpse()\n#&gt; FileSystemDataset with 1 csv file\n#&gt; 41,389,465 rows x 12 columns\n#&gt; $ UsageClass      &lt;string&gt; \"Physical\", \"Physical\", \"Digital\", \"Physical\", \"Ph…\n#&gt; $ CheckoutType    &lt;string&gt; \"Horizon\", \"Horizon\", \"OverDrive\", \"Horizon\", \"Hor…\n#&gt; $ MaterialType    &lt;string&gt; \"BOOK\", \"BOOK\", \"EBOOK\", \"BOOK\", \"SOUNDDISC\", \"BOO…\n#&gt; $ CheckoutYear     &lt;int64&gt; 2016, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2016, 2016, 20…\n#&gt; $ CheckoutMonth    &lt;int64&gt; 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6,…\n#&gt; $ Checkouts        &lt;int64&gt; 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2,…\n#&gt; $ Title           &lt;string&gt; \"Super rich : a guide to having it all / Russell S…\n#&gt; $ ISBN            &lt;string&gt; \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"…\n#&gt; $ Creator         &lt;string&gt; \"Simmons, Russell\", \"Barclay, James, 1965-\", \"Tim …\n#&gt; $ Subjects        &lt;string&gt; \"Self realization, Conduct of life, Attitude Psych…\n#&gt; $ Publisher       &lt;string&gt; \"Gotham Books,\", \"Pyr,\", \"Random House, Inc.\", \"Di…\n#&gt; $ PublicationYear &lt;string&gt; \"c2011.\", \"2010.\", \"2015\", \"2005.\", \"c2004.\", \"c20…\n\nWe can start to use this dataset with dplyr verbs, using collect() to force arrow to perform the computation and return some data. For example, this code tells us the total number of checkouts per year:\n\nseattle_csv |&gt; \n  group_by(CheckoutYear) |&gt; \n  summarise(Checkouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt; \n  arrange(CheckoutYear) |&gt; \n  collect()\n#&gt; # A tibble: 18 × 2\n#&gt;   CheckoutYear Checkouts\n#&gt;          &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n#&gt; 1         2005   3798685\n#&gt; 2         2006   6599318\n#&gt; 3         2007   7126627\n#&gt; 4         2008   8438486\n#&gt; 5         2009   9135167\n#&gt; 6         2010   8608966\n#&gt; # ℹ 12 more rows\n\nThanks to arrow, this code will work regardless of how large the underlying dataset is. But it’s currently rather slow: on Hadley’s computer, it took ~10s to run. That’s not terrible given how much data we have, but we can make it much faster by switching to a better format.",

    "section": "\n22.4 The parquet format",
    "text": "22.4 The parquet format\nTo make this data easier to work with, let’s switch to the parquet file format and split it up into multiple files. The following sections will first introduce you to parquet and partitioning, and then apply what we learned to the Seattle library data.\n\n22.4.1 Advantages of parquet\nLike CSV, parquet is used for rectangular data, but instead of being a text format that you can read with any file editor, it’s a custom binary format designed specifically for the needs of big data. This means that:\n\nParquet files are usually smaller than the equivalent CSV file. Parquet relies on efficient encodings to keep file size down, and supports file compression. This helps make parquet files fast because there’s less data to move from disk to memory.\nParquet files have a rich type system. As we talked about in Section 7.3, a CSV file does not provide any information about column types. For example, a CSV reader has to guess whether \"08-10-2022\" should be parsed as a string or a date. In contrast, parquet files store data in a way that records the type along with the data.\nParquet files are “column-oriented”. This means that they’re organized column-by-column, much like R’s data frame. This typically leads to better performance for data analysis tasks compared to CSV files, which are organized row-by-row.\nParquet files are “chunked”, which makes it possible to work on different parts of the file at the same time, and, if you’re lucky, to skip some chunks altogether.\n\nThere’s one primary disadvantage to parquet files: they are no longer “human readable”, i.e. if you look at a parquet file using readr::read_file(), you’ll just see a bunch of gibberish.\n\n22.4.2 Partitioning\nAs datasets get larger and larger, storing all the data in a single file gets increasingly painful and it’s often useful to split large datasets across many files. When this structuring is done intelligently, this strategy can lead to significant improvements in performance because many analyses will only require a subset of the files.\nThere are no hard and fast rules about how to partition your dataset: the results will depend on your data, access patterns, and the systems that read the data. You’re likely to need to do some experimentation before you find the ideal partitioning for your situation. As a rough guide, arrow suggests that you avoid files smaller than 20MB and larger than 2GB and avoid partitions that produce more than 10,000 files. You should also try to partition by variables that you filter by; as you’ll see shortly, that allows arrow to skip a lot of work by reading only the relevant files.\n\n22.4.3 Rewriting the Seattle library data\nLet’s apply these ideas to the Seattle library data to see how they play out in practice. We’re going to partition by CheckoutYear, since it’s likely some analyses will only want to look at recent data and partitioning by year yields 18 chunks of a reasonable size.\nTo rewrite the data we define the partition using dplyr::group_by() and then save the partitions to a directory with arrow::write_dataset(). write_dataset() has two important arguments: a directory where we’ll create the files and the format we’ll use.\n\npq_path &lt;- \"data/seattle-library-checkouts\"\n\n\nseattle_csv |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutYear) |&gt;\n  write_dataset(path = pq_path, format = \"parquet\")\n\nThis takes about a minute to run; as we’ll see shortly this is an initial investment that pays off by making future operations much much faster.\nLet’s take a look at what we just produced:\n\ntibble(\n  files = list.files(pq_path, recursive = TRUE),\n  size_MB = file.size(file.path(pq_path, files)) / 1024^2\n)\n#&gt; # A tibble: 18 × 2\n#&gt;   files                            size_MB\n#&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;                              &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1 CheckoutYear=2005/part-0.parquet    109.\n#&gt; 2 CheckoutYear=2006/part-0.parquet    164.\n#&gt; 3 CheckoutYear=2007/part-0.parquet    178.\n#&gt; 4 CheckoutYear=2008/part-0.parquet    195.\n#&gt; 5 CheckoutYear=2009/part-0.parquet    214.\n#&gt; 6 CheckoutYear=2010/part-0.parquet    222.\n#&gt; # ℹ 12 more rows\n\nOur single 9GB CSV file has been rewritten into 18 parquet files. The file names use a “self-describing” convention used by the Apache Hive project. Hive-style partitions name folders with a “key=value” convention, so as you might guess, the CheckoutYear=2005 directory contains all the data where CheckoutYear is 2005. Each file is between 100 and 300 MB and the total size is now around 4 GB, a little over half the size of the original CSV file. This is as we expect since parquet is a much more efficient format.",

    "text": "22.5 Using dplyr with arrow\nNow we’ve created these parquet files, we’ll need to read them in again. We use open_dataset() again, but this time we give it a directory:\n\nseattle_pq &lt;- open_dataset(pq_path)\n\nNow we can write our dplyr pipeline. For example, we could count the total number of books checked out in each month for the last five years:\n\nquery &lt;- seattle_pq |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear &gt;= 2018, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutYear, CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(CheckoutYear, CheckoutMonth)\n\nWriting dplyr code for arrow data is conceptually similar to dbplyr, Chapter 21: you write dplyr code, which is automatically transformed into a query that the Apache Arrow C++ library understands, which is then executed when you call collect(). If we print out the query object we can see a little information about what we expect Arrow to return when the execution takes place:\n\nquery\n#&gt; FileSystemDataset (query)\n#&gt; CheckoutYear: int32\n#&gt; CheckoutMonth: int64\n#&gt; TotalCheckouts: int64\n#&gt; \n#&gt; * Grouped by CheckoutYear\n#&gt; * Sorted by CheckoutYear [asc], CheckoutMonth [asc]\n#&gt; See $.data for the source Arrow object\n\nAnd we can get the results by calling collect():\n\nquery |&gt; collect()\n#&gt; # A tibble: 58 × 3\n#&gt; # Groups:   CheckoutYear [5]\n#&gt;   CheckoutYear CheckoutMonth TotalCheckouts\n#&gt;          &lt;int&gt;         &lt;int&gt;          &lt;int&gt;\n#&gt; 1         2018             1         355101\n#&gt; 2         2018             2         309813\n#&gt; 3         2018             3         344487\n#&gt; 4         2018             4         330988\n#&gt; 5         2018             5         318049\n#&gt; 6         2018             6         341825\n#&gt; # ℹ 52 more rows\n\nLike dbplyr, arrow only understands some R expressions, so you may not be able to write exactly the same code you usually would. However, the list of operations and functions supported is fairly extensive and continues to grow; find a complete list of currently supported functions in ?acero.\n\n22.5.1 Performance\nLet’s take a quick look at the performance impact of switching from CSV to parquet. First, let’s time how long it takes to calculate the number of books checked out in each month of 2021, when the data is stored as a single large csv:\n\nseattle_csv |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear == 2021, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(CheckoutMonth)) |&gt;\n  collect() |&gt; \n  system.time()\n#&gt;    user  system elapsed \n#&gt;  11.951   1.297  11.387\n\nNow let’s use our new version of the dataset in which the Seattle library checkout data has been partitioned into 18 smaller parquet files:\n\nseattle_pq |&gt; \n  filter(CheckoutYear == 2021, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutMonth) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(CheckoutMonth)) |&gt;\n  collect() |&gt; \n  system.time()\n#&gt;    user  system elapsed \n#&gt;   0.263   0.058   0.063\n\nThe ~100x speedup in performance is attributable to two factors: the multi-file partitioning, and the format of individual files:\n\nPartitioning improves performance because this query uses CheckoutYear == 2021 to filter the data, and arrow is smart enough to recognize that it only needs to read 1 of the 18 parquet files.\nThe parquet format improves performance by storing data in a binary format that can be read more directly into memory. The column-wise format and rich metadata means that arrow only needs to read the four columns actually used in the query (CheckoutYear, MaterialType, CheckoutMonth, and Checkouts).\n\nThis massive difference in performance is why it pays off to convert large CSVs to parquet!\n\n22.5.2 Using duckdb with arrow\nThere’s one last advantage of parquet and arrow — it’s very easy to turn an arrow dataset into a DuckDB database (Chapter 21) by calling arrow::to_duckdb():\n\nseattle_pq |&gt; \n  to_duckdb() |&gt;\n  filter(CheckoutYear &gt;= 2018, MaterialType == \"BOOK\") |&gt;\n  group_by(CheckoutYear) |&gt;\n  summarize(TotalCheckouts = sum(Checkouts)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(CheckoutYear)) |&gt;\n  collect()\n#&gt; Warning: Missing values are always removed in SQL aggregation functions.\n#&gt; Use `na.rm = TRUE` to silence this warning\n#&gt; This warning is displayed once every 8 hours.\n#&gt; # A tibble: 5 × 2\n#&gt;   CheckoutYear TotalCheckouts\n#&gt;          &lt;int&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt; 1         2022        2431502\n#&gt; 2         2021        2266438\n#&gt; 3         2020        1241999\n#&gt; 4         2019        3931688\n#&gt; 5         2018        3987569\n\nThe neat thing about to_duckdb() is that the transfer doesn’t involve any memory copying, and speaks to the goals of the arrow ecosystem: enabling seamless transitions from one computing environment to another.\n\n22.5.3 Exercises\n\nFigure out the most popular book each year.\nWhich author has the most books in the Seattle library system?\nHow has checkouts of books vs ebooks changed over the last 10 years?",

These vectors are simple because they’re homogeneous: every element is of the same data type. If you want to store elements of different types in the same vector, you’ll need a list, which you create with list():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s often convenient to name the components, or children, of a list, which you can do in the same way as naming the columns of a tibble:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nEven for these very simple lists, printing takes up quite a lot of space. A useful alternative is str(), which generates a compact display of the structure, de-emphasizing the contents:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAs you can see, str() displays each child of the list on its own line. It displays the name, if present, then an abbreviation of the type, then the first few values.\n\n23.2.1 Hierarchy\nLists can contain any type of object, including other lists. This makes them suitable for representing hierarchical (tree-like) structures:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis is notably different to c(), which generates a flat vector:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAs lists get more complex, str() gets more useful, as it lets you see the hierarchy at a glance:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAs lists get even larger and more complex, str() eventually starts to fail, and you’ll need to switch to View()1. Figure 23.1 shows the result of calling View(x5). The viewer starts by showing just the top level of the list, but you can interactively expand any of the components to see more, as in Figure 23.2. RStudio will also show you the code you need to access that element, as in Figure 23.3. We’ll come back to how this code works in Section 27.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.1: The RStudio view lets you interactively explore a complex list. The viewer opens showing only the top level of the list.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.2: Clicking on the rightward facing triangle expands that component of the list so that you can also see its children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.3: You can repeat this operation as many times as needed to get to the data you’re interested in. Note the bottom-left corner: if you click an element of the list, RStudio will give you the subsetting code needed to access it, in this case x5[[2]][[2]][[2]].\n\n\n\n\n\n23.2.2 List-columns\nLists can also live inside a tibble, where we call them list-columns. List-columns are useful because they allow you to place objects in a tibble that wouldn’t usually belong in there. In particular, list-columns are used a lot in the tidymodels ecosystem, because they allow you to store things like model outputs or resamples in a data frame.\nHere’s a simple example of a list-column:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere’s nothing special about lists in a tibble; they behave like any other column:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nComputing with list-columns is harder, but that’s because computing with lists is harder in general; we’ll come back to that in Chapter 26. In this chapter, we’ll focus on unnesting list-columns out into regular variables so you can use your existing tools on them.\nThe default print method just displays a rough summary of the contents. The list column could be arbitrarily complex, so there’s no good way to print it. If you want to see it, you’ll need to pull out just the one list-column and apply one of the techniques that you’ve learned above, like df |&gt; pull(z) |&gt; str() or df |&gt; pull(z) |&gt; View().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase R\n\n\n\nIt’s possible to put a list in a column of a data.frame, but it’s a lot fiddlier because data.frame() treats a list as a list of columns:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can force data.frame() to treat a list as a list of rows by wrapping it in list I(), but the result doesn’t print particularly well:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt’s easier to use list-columns with tibbles because tibble() treats lists like vectors and the print method has been designed with lists in mind.",

    "text": "23.3 Unnesting\nNow that you’ve learned the basics of lists and list-columns, let’s explore how you can turn them back into regular rows and columns. Here we’ll use very simple sample data so you can get the basic idea; in the next section we’ll switch to real data.\nList-columns tend to come in two basic forms: named and unnamed. When the children are named, they tend to have the same names in every row. For example, in df1, every element of list-column y has two elements named a and b. Named list-columns naturally unnest into columns: each named element becomes a new named column.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen the children are unnamed, the number of elements tends to vary from row-to-row. For example, in df2, the elements of list-column y are unnamed and vary in length from one to three. Unnamed list-columns naturally unnest into rows: you’ll get one row for each child.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\ntidyr provides two functions for these two cases: unnest_wider() and unnest_longer(). The following sections explain how they work.\n\n23.3.1 unnest_wider()\n\nWhen each row has the same number of elements with the same names, like df1, it’s natural to put each component into its own column with unnest_wider():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBy default, the names of the new columns come exclusively from the names of the list elements, but you can use the names_sep argument to request that they combine the column name and the element name. This is useful for disambiguating repeated names.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n23.3.2 unnest_longer()\n\nWhen each row contains an unnamed list, it’s most natural to put each element into its own row with unnest_longer():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote how x is duplicated for each element inside of y: we get one row of output for each element inside the list-column. But what happens if one of the elements is empty, as in the following example?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe get zero rows in the output, so the row effectively disappears. If you want to preserve that row, adding NA in y, set keep_empty = TRUE.\n\n23.3.3 Inconsistent types\nWhat happens if you unnest a list-column that contains different types of vector? For example, take the following dataset where the list-column y contains two numbers, a character, and a logical, which can’t normally be mixed in a single column.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nunnest_longer() always keeps the set of columns unchanged, while changing the number of rows. So what happens? How does unnest_longer() produce five rows while keeping everything in y?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAs you can see, the output contains a list-column, but every element of the list-column contains a single element. Because unnest_longer() can’t find a common type of vector, it keeps the original types in a list-column. You might wonder if this breaks the commandment that every element of a column must be the same type. It doesn’t: every element is a list, even though the contents are of different types.\nDealing with inconsistent types is challenging and the details depend on the precise nature of the problem and your goals, but you’ll most likely need tools from Chapter 26.\n\n23.3.4 Other functions\ntidyr has a few other useful rectangling functions that we’re not going to cover in this book:\n\n\nunnest_auto() automatically picks between unnest_longer() and unnest_wider() based on the structure of the list-column. It’s great for rapid exploration, but ultimately it’s a bad idea because it doesn’t force you to understand how your data is structured, and makes your code harder to understand.\n\nunnest() expands both rows and columns. It’s useful when you have a list-column that contains a 2d structure like a data frame, which you don’t see in this book, but you might encounter if you use the tidymodels ecosystem.\n\nThese functions are good to know about as you might encounter them when reading other people’s code or tackling rarer rectangling challenges yourself.\n\n23.3.5 Exercises\n\nWhat happens when you use unnest_wider() with unnamed list-columns like df2? What argument is now necessary? What happens to missing values?\nWhat happens when you use unnest_longer() with named list-columns like df1? What additional information do you get in the output? How can you suppress that extra detail?\n\nFrom time-to-time you encounter data frames with multiple list-columns with aligned values. For example, in the following data frame, the values of y and z are aligned (i.e. y and z will always have the same length within a row, and the first value of y corresponds to the first value of z). What happens if you apply two unnest_longer() calls to this data frame? How can you preserve the relationship between x and y? (Hint: carefully read the docs).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "section": "\n23.4 Case studies",
    "text": "23.4 Case studies\nThe main difference between the simple examples we used above and real data is that real data typically contains multiple levels of nesting that require multiple calls to unnest_longer() and/or unnest_wider(). To show that in action, this section works through three real rectangling challenges using datasets from the repurrrsive package.\n\n23.4.1 Very wide data\nWe’ll start with gh_repos. This is a list that contains data about a collection of GitHub repositories retrieved using the GitHub API. It’s a very deeply nested list so it’s difficult to show the structure in this book; we recommend exploring a little on your own with View(gh_repos) before we continue.\ngh_repos is a list, but our tools work with list-columns, so we’ll begin by putting it into a tibble. We call this column json for reasons we’ll get to later.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis tibble contains 6 rows, one row for each child of gh_repos. Each row contains an unnamed list with either 26 or 30 rows. Since these are unnamed, we’ll start with unnest_longer() to put each child in its own row:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAt first glance, it might seem like we haven’t improved the situation: while we have more rows (176 instead of 6) each element of json is still a list. However, there’s an important difference: now each element is a named list so we can use unnest_wider() to put each element into its own column:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis has worked but the result is a little overwhelming: there are so many columns that tibble doesn’t even print all of them! We can see them all with names(); and here we look at the first 10:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nLet’s pull out a few that look interesting:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can use this to work back to understand how gh_repos was structured: each child was a GitHub user containing a list of up to 30 GitHub repositories that they created.\nowner is another list-column, and since it contains a named list, we can use unnest_wider() to get at the values:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUh oh, this list column also contains an id column and we can’t have two id columns in the same data frame. As suggested, lets use names_sep to resolve the problem:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis gives another wide dataset, but you can get the sense that owner appears to contain a lot of additional data about the person who “owns” the repository.\n\n23.4.2 Relational data\nNested data is sometimes used to represent data that we’d usually spread across multiple data frames. For example, take got_chars which contains data about characters that appear in the Game of Thrones books and TV series. Like gh_repos it’s a list, so we start by turning it into a list-column of a tibble:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe json column contains named elements, so we’ll start by widening it:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnd selecting a few columns to make it easier to read:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis dataset contains also many list-columns:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nLet’s explore the titles column. It’s an unnamed list-column, so we’ll unnest it into rows:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou might expect to see this data in its own table because it would be easy to join to the characters data as needed. Let’s do that, which requires little cleaning: removing the rows containing empty strings and renaming titles to title since each row now only contains a single title.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou could imagine creating a table like this for each of the list-columns, then using joins to combine them with the character data as you need it.\n\n23.4.3 Deeply nested\nWe’ll finish off these case studies with a list-column that’s very deeply nested and requires repeated rounds of unnest_wider() and unnest_longer() to unravel: gmaps_cities. This is a two column tibble containing five city names and the results of using Google’s geocoding API to determine their location:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\njson is a list-column with internal names, so we start with an unnest_wider():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis gives us the status and the results. We’ll drop the status column since they’re all OK; in a real analysis, you’d also want to capture all the rows where status != \"OK\" and figure out what went wrong. results is an unnamed list, with either one or two elements (we’ll see why shortly) so we’ll unnest it into rows:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow results is a named list, so we’ll use unnest_wider():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow we can see why two cities got two results: Washington matched both Washington state and Washington, DC, and Arlington matched Arlington, Virginia and Arlington, Texas.\nThere are a few different places we could go from here. We might want to determine the exact location of the match, which is stored in the geometry list-column:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThat gives us new bounds (a rectangular region) and location (a point). We can unnest location to see the latitude (lat) and longitude (lng):\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nExtracting the bounds requires a few more steps:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe then rename southwest and northeast (the corners of the rectangle) so we can use names_sep to create short but evocative names:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote how we unnest two columns simultaneously by supplying a vector of variable names to unnest_wider().\nOnce you’ve discovered the path to get to the components you’re interested in, you can extract them directly using another tidyr function, hoist():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf these case studies have whetted your appetite for more real-life rectangling, you can see a few more examples in vignette(\"rectangling\", package = \"tidyr\").\n\n23.4.4 Exercises\n\nRoughly estimate when gh_repos was created. Why can you only roughly estimate the date?\nThe owner column of gh_repo contains a lot of duplicated information because each owner can have many repos. Can you construct an owners data frame that contains one row for each owner? (Hint: does distinct() work with list-cols?)\nFollow the steps used for titles to create similar tables for the aliases, allegiances, books, and TV series for the Game of Thrones characters.\n\nExplain the following code line-by-line. Why is it interesting? Why does it work for got_chars but might not work in general?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nIn gmaps_cities, what does address_components contain? Why does the length vary between rows? Unnest it appropriately to figure it out. (Hint: types always appears to contain two elements. Does unnest_wider() make it easier to work with than unnest_longer()?) .",

    "section": "\n23.5 JSON",
    "text": "23.5 JSON\nAll of the case studies in the previous section were sourced from wild-caught JSON. JSON is short for javascript object notation and is the way that most web APIs return data. It’s important to understand it because while JSON and R’s data types are pretty similar, there isn’t a perfect 1-to-1 mapping, so it’s good to understand a bit about JSON if things go wrong.\n\n23.5.1 Data types\nJSON is a simple format designed to be easily read and written by machines, not humans. It has six key data types. Four of them are scalars:\n\nThe simplest type is a null (null) which plays the same role as NA in R. It represents the absence of data.\nA string is much like a string in R, but must always use double quotes.\nA number is similar to R’s numbers: they can use integer (e.g., 123), decimal (e.g., 123.45), or scientific (e.g., 1.23e3) notation. JSON doesn’t support Inf, -Inf, or NaN.\nA boolean is similar to R’s TRUE and FALSE, but uses lowercase true and false.\n\nJSON’s strings, numbers, and booleans are pretty similar to R’s character, numeric, and logical vectors. The main difference is that JSON’s scalars can only represent a single value. To represent multiple values you need to use one of the two remaining types: arrays and objects.\nBoth arrays and objects are similar to lists in R; the difference is whether or not they’re named. An array is like an unnamed list, and is written with []. For example [1, 2, 3] is an array containing 3 numbers, and [null, 1, \"string\", false] is an array that contains a null, a number, a string, and a boolean. An object is like a named list, and is written with {}. The names (keys in JSON terminology) are strings, so must be surrounded by quotes. For example, {\"x\": 1, \"y\": 2} is an object that maps x to 1 and y to 2.\nNote that JSON doesn’t have any native way to represent dates or date-times, so they’re often stored as strings, and you’ll need to use readr::parse_date() or readr::parse_datetime() to turn them into the correct data structure. Similarly, JSON’s rules for representing floating point numbers in JSON are a little imprecise, so you’ll also sometimes find numbers stored in strings. Apply readr::parse_double() as needed to get the correct variable type.\n\n23.5.2 jsonlite\nTo convert JSON into R data structures, we recommend the jsonlite package, by Jeroen Ooms. We’ll use only two jsonlite functions: read_json() and parse_json(). In real life, you’ll use read_json() to read a JSON file from disk. For example, the repurrsive package also provides the source for gh_user as a JSON file and you can read it with read_json():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn this book, we’ll also use parse_json(), since it takes a string containing JSON, which makes it good for generating simple examples. To get started, here are three simple JSON datasets, starting with a number, then putting a few numbers in an array, then putting that array in an object:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\njsonlite has another important function called fromJSON(). We don’t use it here because it performs automatic simplification (simplifyVector = TRUE). This often works well, particularly in simple cases, but we think you’re better off doing the rectangling yourself so you know exactly what’s happening and can more easily handle the most complicated nested structures.\n\n23.5.3 Starting the rectangling process\nIn most cases, JSON files contain a single top-level array, because they’re designed to provide data about multiple “things”, e.g., multiple pages, or multiple records, or multiple results. In this case, you’ll start your rectangling with tibble(json) so that each element becomes a row:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn rarer cases, the JSON file consists of a single top-level JSON object, representing one “thing”. In this case, you’ll need to kick off the rectangling process by wrapping it in a list, before you put it in a tibble.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAlternatively, you can reach inside the parsed JSON and start with the bit that you actually care about:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n23.5.4 Exercises\n\n\nRectangle the df_col and df_row below. They represent the two ways of encoding a data frame in JSON.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

Some websites will offer an API, a set of structured HTTP requests that return data as JSON, which you handle using the techniques from Chapter 23. Where possible, you should use the API1, because typically it will give you more reliable data. Unfortunately, however, programming with web APIs is out of scope for this book. Instead, we are teaching scraping, a technique that works whether or not a site provides an API.\nIn this chapter, we’ll first discuss the ethics and legalities of scraping before we dive into the basics of HTML. You’ll then learn the basics of CSS selectors to locate specific elements on the page, and how to use rvest functions to get data from text and attributes out of HTML and into R. We’ll then discuss some techniques to figure out what CSS selector you need for the page you’re scraping, before finishing up with a couple of case studies, and a brief discussion of dynamic websites.",

    "section": "\n24.2 Scraping ethics and legalities",
    "text": "24.2 Scraping ethics and legalities\nBefore we get started discussing the code you’ll need to perform web scraping, we need to talk about whether it’s legal and ethical for you to do so. Overall, the situation is complicated with regards to both of these.\nLegalities depend a lot on where you live. However, as a general principle, if the data is public, non-personal, and factual, you’re likely to be ok2. These three factors are important because they’re connected to the site’s terms and conditions, personally identifiable information, and copyright, as we’ll discuss below.\nIf the data isn’t public, non-personal, or factual or you’re scraping the data specifically to make money with it, you’ll need to talk to a lawyer. In any case, you should be respectful of the resources of the server hosting the pages you are scraping. Most importantly, this means that if you’re scraping many pages, you should make sure to wait a little between each request. One easy way to do so is to use the polite package by Dmytro Perepolkin. It will automatically pause between requests and cache the results so you never ask for the same page twice.\n\n24.2.1 Terms of service\nIf you look closely, you’ll find many websites include a “terms and conditions” or “terms of service” link somewhere on the page, and if you read that page closely you’ll often discover that the site specifically prohibits web scraping. These pages tend to be a legal land grab where companies make very broad claims. It’s polite to respect these terms of service where possible, but take any claims with a grain of salt.\nUS courts have generally found that simply putting the terms of service in the footer of the website isn’t sufficient for you to be bound by them, e.g., HiQ Labs v. LinkedIn. Generally, to be bound to the terms of service, you must have taken some explicit action like creating an account or checking a box. This is why whether or not the data is public is important; if you don’t need an account to access them, it is unlikely that you are bound to the terms of service. Note, however, the situation is rather different in Europe where courts have found that terms of service are enforceable even if you don’t explicitly agree to them.\n\n24.2.2 Personally identifiable information\nEven if the data is public, you should be extremely careful about scraping personally identifiable information like names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, etc. Europe has particularly strict laws about the collection or storage of such data (GDPR), and regardless of where you live you’re likely to be entering an ethical quagmire. For example, in 2016, a group of researchers scraped public profile information (e.g., usernames, age, gender, location, etc.) about 70,000 people on the dating site OkCupid and they publicly released these data without any attempts for anonymization. While the researchers felt that there was nothing wrong with this since the data were already public, this work was widely condemned due to ethics concerns around identifiability of users whose information was released in the dataset. If your work involves scraping personally identifiable information, we strongly recommend reading about the OkCupid study3 as well as similar studies with questionable research ethics involving the acquisition and release of personally identifiable information.\n\n24.2.3 Copyright\nFinally, you also need to worry about copyright law. Copyright law is complicated, but it’s worth taking a look at the US law which describes exactly what’s protected: “[…] original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression, […]”. It then goes on to describe specific categories that it applies like literary works, musical works, motion pictures and more. Notably absent from copyright protection are data. This means that as long as you limit your scraping to facts, copyright protection does not apply. (But note that Europe has a separate “sui generis” right that protects databases.)\nAs a brief example, in the US, lists of ingredients and instructions are not copyrightable, so copyright can not be used to protect a recipe. But if that list of recipes is accompanied by substantial novel literary content, that is copyrightable. This is why when you’re looking for a recipe on the internet there’s always so much content beforehand.\nIf you do need to scrape original content (like text or images), you may still be protected under the doctrine of fair use. Fair use is not a hard and fast rule, but weighs up a number of factors. It’s more likely to apply if you are collecting the data for research or non-commercial purposes and if you limit what you scrape to just what you need.",

    "section": "\n24.3 HTML basics",
    "text": "24.3 HTML basics\nTo scrape webpages, you need to first understand a little bit about HTML, the language that describes web pages. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and looks something like this:\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;title&gt;Page title&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;h1 id='first'&gt;A heading&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Some text &amp; &lt;b&gt;some bold text.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;img src='myimg.png' width='100' height='100'&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\nHTML has a hierarchical structure formed by elements which consist of a start tag (e.g., &lt;tag&gt;), optional attributes (id='first'), an end tag4 (like &lt;/tag&gt;), and contents (everything in between the start and end tag).\nSince &lt; and &gt; are used for start and end tags, you can’t write them directly. Instead you have to use the HTML escapes &gt; (greater than) and &lt; (less than). And since those escapes use &, if you want a literal ampersand you have to escape it as &amp;. There are a wide range of possible HTML escapes but you don’t need to worry about them too much because rvest automatically handles them for you.\nWeb scraping is possible because most pages that contain data that you want to scrape generally have a consistent structure.\n\n24.3.1 Elements\nThere are over 100 HTML elements. Some of the most important are:\n\nEvery HTML page must be in an &lt;html&gt; element, and it must have two children: &lt;head&gt;, which contains document metadata like the page title, and &lt;body&gt;, which contains the content you see in the browser.\nBlock tags like &lt;h1&gt; (heading 1), &lt;section&gt; (section), &lt;p&gt; (paragraph), and &lt;ol&gt; (ordered list) form the overall structure of the page.\nInline tags like &lt;b&gt; (bold), &lt;i&gt; (italics), and &lt;a&gt; (link) format text inside block tags.\n\nIf you encounter a tag that you’ve never seen before, you can find out what it does with a little googling. Another good place to start are the MDN Web Docs which describe just about every aspect of web programming.\nMost elements can have content in between their start and end tags. This content can either be text or more elements. For example, the following HTML contains paragraph of text, with one word in bold.\n&lt;p&gt;\n  Hi! My &lt;b&gt;name&lt;/b&gt; is Hadley.\n&lt;/p&gt;\nThe children are the elements it contains, so the &lt;p&gt; element above has one child, the &lt;b&gt; element. The &lt;b&gt; element has no children, but it does have contents (the text “name”).\n\n24.3.2 Attributes\nTags can have named attributes which look like name1='value1' name2='value2'. Two of the most important attributes are id and class, which are used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to control the visual appearance of the page. These are often useful when scraping data off a page. Attributes are also used to record the destination of links (the href attribute of &lt;a&gt; elements) and the source of images (the src attribute of the &lt;img&gt; element).",

    "text": "24.4 Extracting data\nTo get started scraping, you’ll need the URL of the page you want to scrape, which you can usually copy from your web browser. You’ll then need to read the HTML for that page into R with read_html(). This returns an xml_document5 object which you’ll then manipulate using rvest functions:\n\nhtml &lt;- read_html(\"http://rvest.tidyverse.org/\")\nhtml\n\n{html_document}\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n[1] &lt;head&gt;\\n&lt;meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8 ...\n[2] &lt;body&gt;\\n    &lt;a href=\"#container\" class=\"visually-hidden-focusable\"&gt;Skip t ...\n\n\nrvest also includes a function that lets you write HTML inline. We’ll use this a bunch in this chapter as we teach how the various rvest functions work with simple examples.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow that you have the HTML in R, it’s time to extract the data of interest. You’ll first learn about the CSS selectors that allow you to identify the elements of interest and the rvest functions that you can use to extract data from them. Then we’ll briefly cover HTML tables, which have some special tools.\n\n24.4.1 Find elements\nCSS is short for cascading style sheets, and is a tool for defining the visual styling of HTML documents. CSS includes a miniature language for selecting elements on a page called CSS selectors. CSS selectors define patterns for locating HTML elements, and are useful for scraping because they provide a concise way of describing which elements you want to extract.\nWe’ll come back to CSS selectors in more detail in Section 24.5, but luckily you can get a long way with just three:\n\np selects all &lt;p&gt; elements.\n.title selects all elements with class “title”.\n#title selects the element with the id attribute that equals “title”. Id attributes must be unique within a document, so this will only ever select a single element.\n\nLet’s try out these selectors with a simple example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUse html_elements() to find all elements that match the selector:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnother important function is html_element() which always returns the same number of outputs as inputs. If you apply it to a whole document it’ll give you the first match:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere’s an important difference between html_element() and html_elements() when you use a selector that doesn’t match any elements. html_elements() returns a vector of length 0, where html_element() returns a missing value. This will be important shortly.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n24.4.2 Nesting selections\nIn most cases, you’ll use html_elements() and html_element() together, typically using html_elements() to identify elements that will become observations then using html_element() to find elements that will become variables. Let’s see this in action using a simple example. Here we have an unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;) where each list item (&lt;li&gt;) contains some information about four characters from StarWars:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can use html_elements() to make a vector where each element corresponds to a different character:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo extract the name of each character, we use html_element(), because when applied to the output of html_elements() it’s guaranteed to return one response per element:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe distinction between html_element() and html_elements() isn’t important for name, but it is important for weight. We want to get one weight for each character, even if there’s no weight &lt;span&gt;. That’s what html_element() does:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nhtml_elements() finds all weight &lt;span&gt;s that are children of characters. There’s only three of these, so we lose the connection between names and weights:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNow that you’ve selected the elements of interest, you’ll need to extract the data, either from the text contents or some attributes.\n\n24.4.3 Text and attributes\nhtml_text2()6 extracts the plain text contents of an HTML element:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that any escapes will be automatically handled; you’ll only ever see HTML escapes in the source HTML, not in the data returned by rvest.\nhtml_attr() extracts data from attributes:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nhtml_attr() always returns a string, so if you’re extracting numbers or dates, you’ll need to do some post-processing.\n\n24.4.4 Tables\nIf you’re lucky, your data will be already stored in an HTML table, and it’ll be a matter of just reading it from that table. It’s usually straightforward to recognize a table in your browser: it’ll have a rectangular structure of rows and columns, and you can copy and paste it into a tool like Excel.\nHTML tables are built up from four main elements: &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt; (table row), &lt;th&gt; (table heading), and &lt;td&gt; (table data). Here’s a simple HTML table with two columns and three rows:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nrvest provides a function that knows how to read this sort of data: html_table(). It returns a list containing one tibble for each table found on the page. Use html_element() to identify the table you want to extract:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote that x and y have automatically been converted to numbers. This automatic conversion doesn’t always work, so in more complex scenarios you may want to turn it off with convert = FALSE and then do your own conversion.",

    "text": "24.5 Finding the right selectors\nFiguring out the selector you need for your data is typically the hardest part of the problem. You’ll often need to do some experimenting to find a selector that is both specific (i.e. it doesn’t select things you don’t care about) and sensitive (i.e. it does select everything you care about). Lots of trial and error is a normal part of the process! There are two main tools that are available to help you with this process: SelectorGadget and your browser’s developer tools.\nSelectorGadget is a javascript bookmarklet that automatically generates CSS selectors based on the positive and negative examples that you provide. It doesn’t always work, but when it does, it’s magic! You can learn how to install and use SelectorGadget either by reading https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/selectorgadget.html or watching Mine’s video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PetWV5g1Xsc.\nEvery modern browser comes with some toolkit for developers, but we recommend Chrome, even if it isn’t your regular browser: its web developer tools are some of the best and they’re immediately available. Right click on an element on the page and click Inspect. This will open an expandable view of the complete HTML page, centered on the element that you just clicked. You can use this to explore the page and get a sense of what selectors might work. Pay particular attention to the class and id attributes, since these are often used to form the visual structure of the page, and hence make for good tools to extract the data that you’re looking for.\nInside the Elements view, you can also right click on an element and choose Copy as Selector to generate a selector that will uniquely identify the element of interest.\nIf either SelectorGadget or Chrome DevTools have generated a CSS selector that you don’t understand, try Selectors Explained which translates CSS selectors into plain English. If you find yourself doing this a lot, you might want to learn more about CSS selectors generally. We recommend starting with the fun CSS dinner tutorial and then referring to the MDN web docs.",

    "text": "24.6 Putting it all together\nLet’s put this all together to scrape some websites. There’s some risk that these examples may no longer work when you run them — that’s the fundamental challenge of web scraping; if the structure of the site changes, then you’ll have to change your scraping code.\n\n24.6.1 StarWars\nrvest includes a very simple example in vignette(\"starwars\"). This is a simple page with minimal HTML so it’s a good place to start. I’d encourage you to navigate to that page now and use “Inspect Element” to inspect one of the headings that’s the title of a Star Wars movie. Use the keyboard or mouse to explore the hierarchy of the HTML and see if you can get a sense of the shared structure used by each movie.\nYou should be able to see that each movie has a shared structure that looks like this:\n&lt;section&gt;\n  &lt;h2 data-id=\"1\"&gt;The Phantom Menace&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Released: 1999-05-19&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Director: &lt;span class=\"director\"&gt;George Lucas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  \n  &lt;div class=\"crawl\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/section&gt;\nOur goal is to turn this data into a 7 row data frame with variables title, year, director, and intro. We’ll start by reading the HTML and extracting all the &lt;section&gt; elements:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis retrieves seven elements matching the seven movies found on that page, suggesting that using section as a selector is good. Extracting the individual elements is straightforward since the data is always found in the text. It’s just a matter of finding the right selector:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOnce we’ve done that for each component, we can wrap all the results up into a tibble:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe did a little more processing of released to get a variable that will be easy to use later in our analysis.\n\n24.6.2 IMDB top films\nFor our next task we’ll tackle something a little trickier, extracting the top 250 movies from the internet movie database (IMDb). At the time we wrote this chapter, the page looked like Figure 24.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24.1: Screenshot of the IMDb top movies web page taken on 2022-12-05.\n\n\n\n\nThis data has a clear tabular structure so it’s worth starting with html_table():\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://web.archive.org/web/20220201012049/https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/\"\nhtml &lt;- read_html(url)\n\ntable &lt;- html |&gt; \n  html_element(\"table\") |&gt; \n  html_table()\ntable\n\n# A tibble: 250 × 5\n   ``    `Rank & Title`                        `IMDb Rating` `Your Rating` ``   \n   &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;lgl&gt;\n 1 NA    \"1.\\n      The Shawshank Redemption\\…           9.2 \"12345678910… NA   \n 2 NA    \"2.\\n      The Godfather\\n        (1…           9.1 \"12345678910… NA   \n 3 NA    \"3.\\n      The Godfather: Part II\\n …           9   \"12345678910… NA   \n 4 NA    \"4.\\n      The Dark Knight\\n        …           9   \"12345678910… NA   \n 5 NA    \"5.\\n      12 Angry Men\\n        (19…           8.9 \"12345678910… NA   \n 6 NA    \"6.\\n      Schindler's List\\n       …           8.9 \"12345678910… NA   \n 7 NA    \"7.\\n      The Lord of the Rings: Th…           8.9 \"12345678910… NA   \n 8 NA    \"8.\\n      Pulp Fiction\\n        (19…           8.8 \"12345678910… NA   \n 9 NA    \"9.\\n      The Good, the Bad and the…           8.8 \"12345678910… NA   \n10 NA    \"10.\\n      The Lord of the Rings: T…           8.8 \"12345678910… NA   \n# ℹ 240 more rows\n\n\nThis includes a few empty columns, but overall does a good job of capturing the information from the table. However, we need to do some more processing to make it easier to use. First, we’ll rename the columns to be easier to work with, and remove the extraneous whitespace in rank and title. We will do this with select() (instead of rename()) to do the renaming and selecting of just these two columns in one step. Then we’ll remove the new lines and extra spaces, and then apply separate_wider_regex() (from Section 15.3.4) to pull out the title, year, and rank into their own variables.\n\nratings &lt;- table |&gt;\n  select(\n    rank_title_year = `Rank & Title`,\n    rating = `IMDb Rating`\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    rank_title_year = str_replace_all(rank_title_year, \"\\n +\", \" \")\n  ) |&gt; \n  separate_wider_regex(\n    rank_title_year,\n    patterns = c(\n      rank = \"\\\\d+\", \"\\\\. \",\n      title = \".+\", \" +\\\\(\",\n      year = \"\\\\d+\", \"\\\\)\"\n    )\n  )\nratings\n\n# A tibble: 250 × 4\n   rank  title                                             year  rating\n   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                             &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 1     The Shawshank Redemption                          1994     9.2\n 2 2     The Godfather                                     1972     9.1\n 3 3     The Godfather: Part II                            1974     9  \n 4 4     The Dark Knight                                   2008     9  \n 5 5     12 Angry Men                                      1957     8.9\n 6 6     Schindler's List                                  1993     8.9\n 7 7     The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King     2003     8.9\n 8 8     Pulp Fiction                                      1994     8.8\n 9 9     The Good, the Bad and the Ugly                    1966     8.8\n10 10    The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring 2001     8.8\n# ℹ 240 more rows\n\n\nEven in this case where most of the data comes from table cells, it’s still worth looking at the raw HTML. If you do so, you’ll discover that we can add a little extra data by using one of the attributes.

From time-to-time, however, you’ll hit a site where html_elements() and friends don’t return anything like what you see in the browser. In many cases, that’s because you’re trying to scrape a website that dynamically generates the content of the page with javascript. This doesn’t currently work with rvest, because rvest downloads the raw HTML and doesn’t run any javascript.\nIt’s still possible to scrape these types of sites, but rvest needs to use a more expensive process: fully simulating the web browser including running all javascript. This functionality is not available at the time of writing, but it’s something we’re actively working on and might be available by the time you read this. It uses the chromote package which actually runs the Chrome browser in the background, and gives you additional tools to interact with the site, like a human typing text and clicking buttons.

First, you’ve learned about the basics of HTML and using CSS selectors to refer to specific elements, then you’ve learned about using the rvest package to get data out of HTML into R. We then demonstrated web scraping with two case studies: a simpler scenario on scraping data on StarWars films from the rvest package website and a more complex scenario on scraping the top 250 films from IMDB.\nTechnical details of scraping data off the web can be complex, particularly when dealing with sites, however legal and ethical considerations can be even more complex. It’s important for you to educate yourself about both of these before setting out to scrape data.\nThis brings us to the end of the import part of the book where you’ve learned techniques to get data from where it lives (spreadsheets, databases, JSON files, and web sites) into a tidy form in R. Now it’s time to turn our sights to a new topic: making the most of R as a programming language.",

    "text": "25.1 Introduction\nOne of the best ways to improve your reach as a data scientist is to write functions. Functions allow you to automate common tasks in a more powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting. Writing a function has four big advantages over using copy-and-paste:\nA good rule of thumb is to consider writing a function whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice (i.e. you now have three copies of the same code). In this chapter, you’ll learn about three useful types of functions:\nEach of these sections includes many examples to help you generalize the patterns that you see. These examples wouldn’t be possible without the help of folks of twitter, and we encourage follow the links in the comment to see original inspirations. You might also want to read the original motivating tweets for general functions and plotting functions to see even more functions.",

    "text": "25.2 Vector functions\nWe’ll begin with vector functions: functions that take one or more vectors and return a vector result. For example, take a look at this code. What does it do?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou might be able to puzzle out that this rescales each column to have a range from 0 to 1. But did you spot the mistake? When Hadley wrote this code he made an error when copying-and-pasting and forgot to change an a to a b. Preventing this type of mistake is one very good reason to learn how to write functions.\n\n25.2.1 Writing a function\nTo write a function you need to first analyse your repeated code to figure what parts are constant and what parts vary. If we take the code above and pull it outside of mutate(), it’s a little easier to see the pattern because each repetition is now one line:\n(a - min(a, na.rm = TRUE)) / (max(a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(a, na.rm = TRUE))\n(b - min(b, na.rm = TRUE)) / (max(b, na.rm = TRUE) - min(b, na.rm = TRUE))\n(c - min(c, na.rm = TRUE)) / (max(c, na.rm = TRUE) - min(c, na.rm = TRUE))\n(d - min(d, na.rm = TRUE)) / (max(d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(d, na.rm = TRUE))  \nTo make this a bit clearer we can replace the bit that varies with █:\n(█ - min(█, na.rm = TRUE)) / (max(█, na.rm = TRUE) - min(█, na.rm = TRUE))\nTo turn this into a function you need three things:\n\nA name. Here we’ll use rescale01 because this function rescales a vector to lie between 0 and 1.\nThe arguments. The arguments are things that vary across calls and our analysis above tells us that we have just one. We’ll call it x because this is the conventional name for a numeric vector.\nThe body. The body is the code that’s repeated across all the calls.\n\nThen you create a function by following the template:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFor this case that leads to:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAt this point you might test with a few simple inputs to make sure you’ve captured the logic correctly:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThen you can rewrite the call to mutate() as:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n(In Chapter 26, you’ll learn how to use across() to reduce the duplication even further so all you need is df |&gt; mutate(across(a:d, rescale01))).\n\n\n25.2.2 Improving our function\nYou might notice that the rescale01() function does some unnecessary work — instead of computing min() twice and max() once we could instead compute both the minimum and maximum in one step with range():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr you might try this function on a vector that includes an infinite value:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThat result is not particularly useful so we could ask range() to ignore infinite values:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThese changes illustrate an important benefit of functions: because we’ve moved the repeated code into a function, we only need to make the change in one place.\n\n\n25.2.3 Mutate functions\nNow you’ve got the basic idea of functions, let’s take a look at a whole bunch of examples. We’ll start by looking at “mutate” functions, i.e. functions that work well inside of mutate() and filter() because they return an output of the same length as the input.\nLet’s start with a simple variation of rescale01(). Maybe you want to compute the Z-score, rescaling a vector to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr maybe you want to wrap up a straightforward case_when() and give it a useful name. For example, this clamp() function ensures all values of a vector lie in between a minimum or a maximum:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOf course functions don’t just need to work with numeric variables. You might want to do some repeated string manipulation. Maybe you need to make the first character upper case:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr maybe you want to strip percent signs, commas, and dollar signs from a string before converting it into a number:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSometimes your functions will be highly specialized for one data analysis step. For example, if you have a bunch of variables that record missing values as 997, 998, or 999, you might want to write a function to replace them with NA:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe’ve focused on examples that take a single vector because we think they’re the most common. But there’s no reason that your function can’t take multiple vector inputs.\n\n\n25.2.4 Summary functions\nAnother important family of vector functions is summary functions, functions that return a single value for use in summarize(). Sometimes this can just be a matter of setting a default argument or two:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr you might wrap up a simple computation, like for the coefficient of variation, which divides the standard deviation by the mean:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr maybe you just want to make a common pattern easier to remember by giving it a memorable name:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also write functions with multiple vector inputs. For example, maybe you want to compute the mean absolute percentage error to help you compare model predictions with actual values:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio\n\n\n\nOnce you start writing functions, there are two RStudio shortcuts that are super useful:\n\nTo find the definition of a function that you’ve written, place the cursor on the name of the function and press F2.\nTo quickly jump to a function, press Ctrl + . to open the fuzzy file and function finder and type the first few letters of your function name. You can also navigate to files, Quarto sections, and more, making it a very handy navigation tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n25.2.5 Exercises\n\nPractice turning the following code snippets into functions. Think about what each function does. What would you call it? How many arguments does it need?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn the second variant of rescale01(), infinite values are left unchanged. Can you rewrite rescale01() so that -Inf is mapped to 0, and Inf is mapped to 1?\nGiven a vector of birthdates, write a function to compute the age in years.\nWrite your own functions to compute the variance and skewness of a numeric vector. You can look up the definitions on Wikipedia or elsewhere.\nWrite both_na(), a summary function that takes two vectors of the same length and returns the number of positions that have an NA in both vectors.\nRead the documentation to figure out what the following functions do.

    "section": "25.3 Data frame functions",
    "text": "25.3 Data frame functions\nVector functions are useful for pulling out code that’s repeated within a dplyr verb. But you’ll often also repeat the verbs themselves, particularly within a large pipeline. When you notice yourself copying and pasting multiple verbs multiple times, you might think about writing a data frame function. Data frame functions work like dplyr verbs: they take a data frame as the first argument, some extra arguments that say what to do with it, and return a data frame or a vector.\nTo let you write a function that uses dplyr verbs, we’ll first introduce you to the challenge of indirection and how you can overcome it with embracing, { }. With this theory under your belt, we’ll then show you a bunch of examples to illustrate what you might do with it.\n\n25.3.1 Indirection and tidy evaluation\nWhen you start writing functions that use dplyr verbs you rapidly hit the problem of indirection. Let’s illustrate the problem with a very simple function: grouped_mean(). The goal of this function is to compute the mean of mean_var grouped by group_var:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf we try and use it, we get an error:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo make the problem a bit more clear, we can use a made up data frame:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nRegardless of how we call grouped_mean() it always does df |&gt; group_by(group_var) |&gt; summarize(mean(mean_var)), instead of df |&gt; group_by(group) |&gt; summarize(mean(x)) or df |&gt; group_by(group) |&gt; summarize(mean(y)). This is a problem of indirection, and it arises because dplyr uses tidy evaluation to allow you to refer to the names of variables inside your data frame without any special treatment.\nTidy evaluation is great 95% of the time because it makes your data analyses very concise as you never have to say which data frame a variable comes from; it’s obvious from the context. The downside of tidy evaluation comes when we want to wrap up repeated tidyverse code into a function. Here we need some way to tell group_by() and summarize() not to treat group_var and mean_var as the name of the variables, but instead look inside them for the variable we actually want to use.\nTidy evaluation includes a solution to this problem called embracing 🤗. Embracing a variable means to wrap it in braces so (e.g.) var becomes { var }. Embracing a variable tells dplyr to use the value stored inside the argument, not the argument as the literal variable name. One way to remember what’s happening is to think of { } as looking down a tunnel — { var } will make a dplyr function look inside of var rather than looking for a variable called var.\nSo to make grouped_mean() work, we need to surround group_var and mean_var with { }:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSuccess!\n\n\n25.3.2 When to embrace?\nSo the key challenge in writing data frame functions is figuring out which arguments need to be embraced. Fortunately, this is easy because you can look it up from the documentation 😄. There are two terms to look for in the docs which correspond to the two most common sub-types of tidy evaluation:\n\nData-masking: this is used in functions like arrange(), filter(), and summarize() that compute with variables.\nTidy-selection: this is used for functions like select(), relocate(), and rename() that select variables.\n\nYour intuition about which arguments use tidy evaluation should be good for many common functions — just think about whether you can compute (e.g., x + 1) or select (e.g., a:x).\nIn the following sections, we’ll explore the sorts of handy functions you might write once you understand embracing.\n\n\n25.3.3 Common use cases\nIf you commonly perform the same set of summaries when doing initial data exploration, you might consider wrapping them up in a helper function:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n(Whenever you wrap summarize() in a helper, we think it’s good practice to set .groups = \"drop\" to both avoid the message and leave the data in an ungrouped state.)\nThe nice thing about this function is, because it wraps summarize(), you can use it on grouped data:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFurthermore, since the arguments to summarize are data-masking also means that the var argument to summary6() is data-masking. That means you can also summarize computed variables:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTo summarize multiple variables, you’ll need to wait until Section 26.2, where you’ll learn how to use across().\nAnother popular summarize() helper function is a version of count() that also computes proportions:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis function has three arguments: df, var, and sort, and only var needs to be embraced because it’s passed to count() which uses data-masking for all variables. Note that we use a default value for sort so that if the user doesn’t supply their own value it will default to FALSE.\nOr maybe you want to find the sorted unique values of a variable for a subset of the data. Rather than supplying a variable and a value to do the filtering, we’ll allow the user to supply a condition:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere we embrace condition because it’s passed to filter() and var because it’s passed to distinct() and arrange().\nWe’ve made all these examples to take a data frame as the first argument, but if you’re working repeatedly with the same data, it can make sense to hardcode it. For example, the following function always works with the flights dataset and always selects time_hour, carrier, and flight since they form the compound primary key that allows you to identify a row.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n25.3.4 Data-masking vs. tidy-selection\nSometimes you want to select variables inside a function that uses data-masking. For example, imagine you want to write a count_missing() that counts the number of missing observations in rows. You might try writing something like:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis doesn’t work because group_by() uses data-masking, not tidy-selection. We can work around that problem by using the handy pick() function, which allows you to use tidy-selection inside data-masking functions:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnother convenient use of pick() is to make a 2d table of counts. Here we count using all the variables in the rows and columns, then use pivot_wider() to rearrange the counts into a grid:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhile our examples have mostly focused on dplyr, tidy evaluation also underpins tidyr, and if you look at the pivot_wider() docs you can see that names_from uses tidy-selection.\n\n\n25.3.5 Exercises\n\nUsing the datasets from nycflights13, write a function that:\n\nFinds all flights that were cancelled (i.e. is.na(arr_time)) or delayed by more than an hour.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nCounts the number of cancelled flights and the number of flights delayed by more than an hour.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFinds all flights that were cancelled or delayed by more than a user supplied number of hours:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSummarizes the weather to compute the minimum, mean, and maximum, of a user supplied variable:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nConverts the user supplied variable that uses clock time (e.g., dep_time, arr_time, etc.) into a decimal time (i.e. hours + (minutes / 60)).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nFor each of the following functions list all arguments that use tidy evaluation and describe whether they use data-masking or tidy-selection: distinct(), count(), group_by(), rename_with(), slice_min(), slice_sample().\nGeneralize the following function so that you can supply any number of variables to count.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

Fortunately, you can use the same techniques with ggplot2, because aes() is a data-masking function. For example, imagine that you’re making a lot of histograms:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWouldn’t it be nice if you could wrap this up into a histogram function?

For example, maybe you want an easy way to eyeball whether or not a dataset is linear by overlaying a smooth line and a straight line:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOr maybe you want an alternative to colored scatterplots for very large datasets where overplotting is a problem:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n25.4.2 Combining with other tidyverse\nSome of the most useful helpers combine a dash of data manipulation with ggplot2. For example, if you might want to do a vertical bar chart where you automatically sort the bars in frequency order using fct_infreq(). Since the bar chart is vertical, we also need to reverse the usual order to get the highest values at the top:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe have to use a new operator here, := (commonly referred to as the “walrus operator”), because we are generating the variable name based on user-supplied data. Variable names go on the left hand side of =, but R’s syntax doesn’t allow anything to the left of = except for a single literal name. To work around this problem, we use the special operator := which tidy evaluation treats in exactly the same way as =.\nOr maybe you want to make it easy to draw a bar plot just for a subset of the data:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can also get creative and display data summaries in other ways. You can find a cool application at https://gist.github.com/GShotwell/b19ef520b6d56f61a830fabb3454965b; it uses the axis labels to display the highest value. As you learn more about ggplot2, the power of your functions will continue to increase.\nWe’ll finish with a more complicated case: labelling the plots you create.\n\n\n25.4.3 Labeling\nRemember the histogram function we showed you earlier?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWouldn’t it be nice if we could label the output with the variable and the bin width that was used? To do so, we’re going to have to go under the covers of tidy evaluation and use a function from the package we haven’t talked about yet: rlang. rlang is a low-level package that’s used by just about every other package in the tidyverse because it implements tidy evaluation (as well as many other useful tools).\nTo solve the labeling problem we can use rlang::englue(). This works similarly to str_glue(), so any value wrapped in { } will be inserted into the string. But it also understands { }, which automatically inserts the appropriate variable name:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can use the same approach in any other place where you want to supply a string in a ggplot2 plot.\n\n\n25.4.4 Exercises\nBuild up a rich plotting function by incrementally implementing each of the steps below:\n\nDraw a scatterplot given dataset and x and y variables.\nAdd a line of best fit (i.e. a linear model with no standard errors).\nAdd a title.",

Ideally, the name of your function will be short, but clearly evoke what the function does. That’s hard! But it’s better to be clear than short, as RStudio’s autocomplete makes it easy to type long names.\nGenerally, function names should be verbs, and arguments should be nouns. There are some exceptions: nouns are ok if the function computes a very well known noun (i.e. mean() is better than compute_mean()), or accessing some property of an object (i.e. coef() is better than get_coefficients()).

You’ll use the first two every time you use across(): the first argument, .cols, specifies which columns you want to iterate over, and the second argument, .fns, specifies what to do with each column. You can use the .names argument when you need additional control over the names of output columns, which is particularly important when you use across() with mutate(). We’ll also discuss two important variations, if_any() and if_all(), which work with filter().\n\n26.2.1 Selecting columns with .cols\n\nThe first argument to across(), .cols, selects the columns to transform. This uses the same specifications as select(), Section 3.3.2, so you can use functions like starts_with() and ends_with() to select columns based on their name.\nThere are two additional selection techniques that are particularly useful for across(): everything() and where(). everything() is straightforward: it selects every (non-grouping) column:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNote grouping columns (grp here) are not included in across(), because they’re automatically preserved by summarize().\nwhere() allows you to select columns based on their type:\n\n\nwhere(is.numeric) selects all numeric columns.\n\nwhere(is.character) selects all string columns.\n\nwhere(is.Date) selects all date columns.\n\nwhere(is.POSIXct) selects all date-time columns.\n\nwhere(is.logical) selects all logical columns.\n\nJust like other selectors, you can combine these with Boolean algebra. For example, !where(is.numeric) selects all non-numeric columns, and starts_with(\"a\") & where(is.logical) selects all logical columns whose name starts with “a”.\n\n26.2.2 Calling a single function\nThe second argument to across() defines how each column will be transformed. In simple cases, as above, this will be a single existing function. This is a pretty special feature of R: we’re passing one function (median, mean, str_flatten, …) to another function (across). This is one of the features that makes R a functional programming language.\nIt’s important to note that we’re passing this function to across(), so across() can call it; we’re not calling it ourselves. That means the function name should never be followed by (). If you forget, you’ll get an error:\ndf |&gt;\n  group_by(grp) |&gt;\n  summarize(across(everything(), median()))\nThis error arises because you’re calling the function with no input, e.g.:\nmedian()\n\n26.2.3 Calling multiple functions\nIn more complex cases, you might want to supply additional arguments or perform multiple transformations. Let’s motivate this problem with a simple example: what happens if we have some missing values in our data? median() propagates those missing values, giving us a suboptimal output:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt would be nice if we could pass along na.rm = TRUE to median() to remove these missing values. To do so, instead of calling median() directly, we need to create a new function that calls median() with the desired arguments:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis is a little verbose, so R comes with a handy shortcut: for this sort of throw away, or anonymous1, function you can replace function with \\2:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIn either case, across() effectively expands to the following code:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen we remove the missing values from the median(), it would be nice to know just how many values were removed. We can find that out by supplying two functions to across(): one to compute the median and the other to count the missing values. You supply multiple functions by using a named list to .fns:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you look carefully, you might intuit that the columns are named using a glue specification (Section 14.3.2) like {.col}_{.fn} where .col is the name of the original column and .fn is the name of the function. That’s not a coincidence! As you’ll learn in the next section, you can use .names argument to supply your own glue spec.\n\n26.2.4 Column names\nThe result of across() is named according to the specification provided in the .names argument. We could specify our own if we wanted the name of the function to come first3:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe .names argument is particularly important when you use across() with mutate(). By default, the output of across() is given the same names as the inputs. This means that across() inside of mutate() will replace existing columns. For example, here we use coalesce() to replace NAs with 0:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf you’d like to instead create new columns, you can use the .names argument to give the output new names:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n26.2.5 Filtering\nacross() is a great match for summarize() and mutate() but it’s more awkward to use with filter(), because you usually combine multiple conditions with either | or &. It’s clear that across() can help to create multiple logical columns, but then what? So dplyr provides two variants of across() called if_any() and if_all():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n26.2.6 across() in functions\nacross() is particularly useful to program with because it allows you to operate on multiple columns. For example, Jacob Scott uses this little helper which wraps a bunch of lubridate functions to expand all date columns into year, month, and day columns:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nacross() also makes it easy to supply multiple columns in a single argument because the first argument uses tidy-select; you just need to remember to embrace that argument, as we discussed in Section 25.3.2. For example, this function will compute the means of numeric columns by default. But by supplying the second argument you can choose to summarize just selected columns:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n26.2.7 Compare with pivot_longer()\n\nBefore we go on, it’s worth pointing out an interesting connection between across() and pivot_longer() (Section 5.3). In many cases, you perform the same calculations by first pivoting the data and then performing the operations by group rather than by column. For example, take this multi-function summary:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe could compute the same values by pivoting longer and then summarizing:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnd if you wanted the same structure as across() you could pivot again:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis is a useful technique to know about because sometimes you’ll hit a problem that’s not currently possible to solve with across(): when you have groups of columns that you want to compute with simultaneously. For example, imagine that our data frame contains both values and weights and we want to compute a weighted mean:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere’s currently no way to do this with across()4, but it’s relatively straightforward with pivot_longer():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIf needed, you could pivot_wider() this back to the original form.\n\n26.2.8 Exercises\n\n\nPractice your across() skills by:\n\nComputing the number of unique values in each column of palmerpenguins::penguins.\nComputing the mean of every column in mtcars.\nGrouping diamonds by cut, clarity, and color then counting the number of observations and computing the mean of each numeric column.\n\n\nWhat happens if you use a list of functions in across(), but don’t name them? How is the output named?\nAdjust expand_dates() to automatically remove the date columns after they’ve been expanded. Do you need to embrace any arguments?\n\nExplain what each step of the pipeline in this function does. What special feature of where() are we taking advantage of?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

    "text": "26.3 Reading multiple files\nIn the previous section, you learned how to use dplyr::across() to repeat a transformation on multiple columns. In this section, you’ll learn how to use purrr::map() to do something to every file in a directory. Let’s start with a little motivation: imagine you have a directory full of excel spreadsheets5 you want to read. You could do it with copy and paste:\n\ndata2019 &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"data/y2019.xlsx\")\ndata2020 &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"data/y2020.xlsx\")\ndata2021 &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"data/y2021.xlsx\")\ndata2022 &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"data/y2022.xlsx\")\n\nAnd then use dplyr::bind_rows() to combine them all together:\n\ndata &lt;- bind_rows(data2019, data2020, data2021, data2022)\n\nYou can imagine that this would get tedious quickly, especially if you had hundreds of files, not just four. The following sections show you how to automate this sort of task. There are three basic steps: use list.files() to list all the files in a directory, then use purrr::map() to read each of them into a list, then use purrr::list_rbind() to combine them into a single data frame. We’ll then discuss how you can handle situations of increasing heterogeneity, where you can’t do exactly the same thing to every file.\n\n26.3.1 Listing files in a directory\nAs the name suggests, list.files() lists the files in a directory. You’ll almost always use three arguments:\n\nThe first argument, path, is the directory to look in.\npattern is a regular expression used to filter the file names. The most common pattern is something like [.]xlsx$ or [.]csv$ to find all files with a specified extension.\nfull.names determines whether or not the directory name should be included in the output. You almost always want this to be TRUE.\n\nTo make our motivating example concrete, this book contains a folder with 12 excel spreadsheets containing data from the gapminder package. Each file contains one year’s worth of data for 142 countries. We can list them all with the appropriate call to list.files():\n\npaths &lt;- list.files(\"data/gapminder\", pattern = \"[.]xlsx$\", full.names = TRUE)\npaths\n\n [1] \"data/gapminder/1952.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/1957.xlsx\"\n [3] \"data/gapminder/1962.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/1967.xlsx\"\n [5] \"data/gapminder/1972.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/1977.xlsx\"\n [7] \"data/gapminder/1982.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/1987.xlsx\"\n [9] \"data/gapminder/1992.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/1997.xlsx\"\n[11] \"data/gapminder/2002.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/2007.xlsx\"\n\n\n\n26.3.2 Lists\nNow that we have these 12 paths, we could call read_excel() 12 times to get 12 data frames:\n\ngapminder_1952 &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/1952.xlsx\")\ngapminder_1957 &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/1957.xlsx\")\ngapminder_1962 &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/1962.xlsx\")\n ...,\ngapminder_2007 &lt;- readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/2007.xlsx\")\n\nBut putting each sheet into its own variable is going to make it hard to work with them a few steps down the road. Instead, they’ll be easier to work with if we put them into a single object. A list is the perfect tool for this job:\n\nfiles &lt;- list(\n  readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/1952.xlsx\"),\n  readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/1957.xlsx\"),\n  readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/1962.xlsx\"),\n  ...,\n  readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/2007.xlsx\")\n)\n\nNow that you have these data frames in a list, how do you get one out? You can use files[[i]] to extract the ith element:\n\nfiles[[3]]\n\n# A tibble: 142 × 5\n   country     continent lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia         32.0 10267083      853.\n 2 Albania     Europe       64.8  1728137     2313.\n 3 Algeria     Africa       48.3 11000948     2551.\n 4 Angola      Africa       34    4826015     4269.\n 5 Argentina   Americas     65.1 21283783     7133.\n 6 Australia   Oceania      70.9 10794968    12217.\n 7 Austria     Europe       69.5  7129864    10751.\n 8 Bahrain     Asia         56.9   171863    12753.\n 9 Bangladesh  Asia         41.2 56839289      686.\n10 Belgium     Europe       70.2  9218400    10991.\n# ℹ 132 more rows\n\n\nWe’ll come back to [[ in more detail in Section 27.3.\n\n26.3.3 purrr::map() and list_rbind()\n\nThe code to collect those data frames in a list “by hand” is basically just as tedious to type as code that reads the files one-by-one. Happily, we can use purrr::map() to make even better use of our paths vector. map() is similar toacross(), but instead of doing something to each column in a data frame, it does something to each element of a vector.map(x, f) is shorthand for:\n\nlist(\n  f(x[[1]]),\n  f(x[[2]]),\n  ...,\n  f(x[[n]])\n)\n\nSo we can use map() to get a list of 12 data frames:\n\nfiles &lt;- map(paths, readxl::read_excel)\nlength(files)\n\n[1] 12\n\nfiles[[1]]\n\n# A tibble: 142 × 5\n   country     continent lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia         28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Albania     Europe       55.2  1282697     1601.\n 3 Algeria     Africa       43.1  9279525     2449.\n 4 Angola      Africa       30.0  4232095     3521.\n 5 Argentina   Americas     62.5 17876956     5911.\n 6 Australia   Oceania      69.1  8691212    10040.\n 7 Austria     Europe       66.8  6927772     6137.\n 8 Bahrain     Asia         50.9   120447     9867.\n 9 Bangladesh  Asia         37.5 46886859      684.\n10 Belgium     Europe       68    8730405     8343.\n# ℹ 132 more rows\n\n\n(This is another data structure that doesn’t display particularly compactly with str() so you might want to load it into RStudio and inspect it with View()).\nNow we can use purrr::list_rbind() to combine that list of data frames into a single data frame:\n\nlist_rbind(files)\n\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 5\n   country     continent lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia         28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Albania     Europe       55.2  1282697     1601.\n 3 Algeria     Africa       43.1  9279525     2449.\n 4 Angola      Africa       30.0  4232095     3521.\n 5 Argentina   Americas     62.5 17876956     5911.\n 6 Australia   Oceania      69.1  8691212    10040.\n 7 Austria     Europe       66.8  6927772     6137.\n 8 Bahrain     Asia         50.9   120447     9867.\n 9 Bangladesh  Asia         37.5 46886859      684.\n10 Belgium     Europe       68    8730405     8343.\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\n\n\nOr we could do both steps at once in a pipeline:\n\npaths |&gt;\n  map(readxl::read_excel) |&gt;\n  list_rbind()\n\nWhat if we want to pass in extra arguments to read_excel()? We use the same technique that we used with across(). For example, it’s often useful to peek at the first few rows of the data with n_max = 1:\n\npaths |&gt;\n  map(\\(path) readxl::read_excel(path, n_max = 1)) |&gt;\n  list_rbind()\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 5\n   country     continent lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia         28.8  8425333      779.\n 2 Afghanistan Asia         30.3  9240934      821.\n 3 Afghanistan Asia         32.0 10267083      853.\n 4 Afghanistan Asia         34.0 11537966      836.\n 5 Afghanistan Asia         36.1 13079460      740.\n 6 Afghanistan Asia         38.4 14880372      786.\n 7 Afghanistan Asia         39.9 12881816      978.\n 8 Afghanistan Asia         40.8 13867957      852.\n 9 Afghanistan Asia         41.7 16317921      649.\n10 Afghanistan Asia         41.8 22227415      635.\n11 Afghanistan Asia         42.1 25268405      727.\n12 Afghanistan Asia         43.8 31889923      975.\n\n\nThis makes it clear that something is missing: there’s no year column because that value is recorded in the path, not in the individual files. We’ll tackle that problem next.\n\n26.3.4 Data in the path\nSometimes the name of the file is data itself. In this example, the file name contains the year, which is not otherwise recorded in the individual files. To get that column into the final data frame, we need to do two things:\nFirst, we name the vector of paths. The easiest way to do this is with the set_names() function, which can take a function. Here we use basename() to extract just the file name from the full path:\n\npaths |&gt; set_names(basename)\n\n                 1952.xlsx                  1957.xlsx \n\"data/gapminder/1952.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/1957.xlsx\" \n                 1962.xlsx                  1967.xlsx \n\"data/gapminder/1962.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/1967.xlsx\" \n                 1972.xlsx                  1977.xlsx \n\"data/gapminder/1972.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/1977.xlsx\" \n                 1982.xlsx                  1987.xlsx \n\"data/gapminder/1982.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/1987.xlsx\" \n                 1992.xlsx                  1997.xlsx \n\"data/gapminder/1992.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/1997.xlsx\" \n                 2002.xlsx                  2007.xlsx \n\"data/gapminder/2002.xlsx\" \"data/gapminder/2007.xlsx\" \n\n\nThose names are automatically carried along by all the map functions, so the list of data frames will have those same names:\n\nfiles &lt;- paths |&gt;\n  set_names(basename) |&gt;\n  map(readxl::read_excel)\n\nThat makes this call to map() shorthand for:\n\nfiles &lt;- list(\n  \"1952.xlsx\" = readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/1952.xlsx\"),\n  \"1957.xlsx\" = readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/1957.xlsx\"),\n  \"1962.xlsx\" = readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/1962.xlsx\"),\n  ...,\n  \"2007.xlsx\" = readxl::read_excel(\"data/gapminder/2007.xlsx\")\n)\n\nYou can also use [[ to extract elements by name:\n\nfiles[[\"1962.xlsx\"]]\n\n# A tibble: 142 × 5\n   country     continent lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia         32.0 10267083      853.\n 2 Albania     Europe       64.8  1728137     2313.\n 3 Algeria     Africa       48.3 11000948     2551.\n 4 Angola      Africa       34    4826015     4269.\n 5 Argentina   Americas     65.1 21283783     7133.\n 6 Australia   Oceania      70.9 10794968    12217.\n 7 Austria     Europe       69.5  7129864    10751.\n 8 Bahrain     Asia         56.9   171863    12753.\n 9 Bangladesh  Asia         41.2 56839289      686.\n10 Belgium     Europe       70.2  9218400    10991.\n# ℹ 132 more rows\n\n\nThen we use the names_to argument to list_rbind() to tell it to save the names into a new column called year then use readr::parse_number() to extract the number from the string.\n\npaths |&gt;\n  set_names(basename) |&gt;\n  map(readxl::read_excel) |&gt;\n  list_rbind(names_to = \"year\") |&gt;\n  mutate(year = parse_number(year))\n\n# A tibble: 1,704 × 6\n    year country     continent lifeExp      pop gdpPercap\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1952 Afghanistan Asia         28.8  8425333      779.\n 2  1952 Albania     Europe       55.2  1282697     1601.\n 3  1952 Algeria     Africa       43.1  9279525     2449.\n 4  1952 Angola      Africa       30.0  4232095     3521.\n 5  1952 Argentina   Americas     62.5 17876956     5911.\n 6  1952 Australia   Oceania      69.1  8691212    10040.\n 7  1952 Austria     Europe       66.8  6927772     6137.\n 8  1952 Bahrain     Asia         50.9   120447     9867.\n 9  1952 Bangladesh  Asia         37.5 46886859      684.\n10  1952 Belgium     Europe       68    8730405     8343.\n# ℹ 1,694 more rows\n\n\nIn more complicated cases, there might be other variables stored in the directory name, or maybe the file name contains multiple bits of data.

For large and richer datasets, using parquet might be a better choice than .csv, as discussed in Section 22.4.\nIf you’re working in a project, we suggest calling the file that does this sort of data prep work something like 0-cleanup.R. The 0 in the file name suggests that this should be run before anything else.\nIf your input data files change over time, you might consider learning a tool like targets to set up your data cleaning code to automatically re-run whenever one of the input files is modified.\n\n26.3.6 Many simple iterations\nHere we’ve just loaded the data directly from disk, and were lucky enough to get a tidy dataset. In most cases, you’ll need to do some additional tidying, and you have two basic options: you can do one round of iteration with a complex function, or do multiple rounds of iteration with simple functions. In our experience most folks reach first for one complex iteration, but you’re often better by doing multiple simple iterations.\nFor example, imagine that you want to read in a bunch of files, filter out missing values, pivot, and then combine. One way to approach the problem is to write a function that takes a file and does all those steps then call map() once:\n\nprocess_file &lt;- function(path) {\n  df &lt;- read_csv(path)\n\n  df |&gt;\n    filter(!is.na(id)) |&gt;\n    mutate(id = tolower(id)) |&gt;\n    pivot_longer(jan:dec, names_to = \"month\")\n}\n\npaths |&gt;\n  map(process_file) |&gt;\n  list_rbind()\n\nAlternatively, you could perform each step of process_file() to every file:\n\npaths |&gt;\n  map(read_csv) |&gt;\n  map(\\(df) df |&gt; filter(!is.na(id))) |&gt;\n  map(\\(df) df |&gt; mutate(id = tolower(id))) |&gt;\n  map(\\(df) df |&gt; pivot_longer(jan:dec, names_to = \"month\")) |&gt;\n  list_rbind()\n\nWe recommend this approach because it stops you getting fixated on getting the first file right before moving on to the rest. By considering all of the data when doing tidying and cleaning, you’re more likely to think holistically and end up with a higher quality result.\nIn this particular example, there’s another optimization you could make, by binding all the data frames together earlier. Then you can rely on regular dplyr behavior:\n\npaths |&gt;\n  map(read_csv) |&gt;\n  list_rbind() |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(id)) |&gt;\n  mutate(id = tolower(id)) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(jan:dec, names_to = \"month\")\n\n\n26.3.7 Heterogeneous data\nUnfortunately, sometimes it’s not possible to go from map() straight to list_rbind() because the data frames are so heterogeneous that list_rbind() either fails or yields a data frame that’s not very useful. In that case, it’s still useful to start by loading all of the files:\n\nfiles &lt;- paths |&gt;\n  map(readxl::read_excel)\n\nThen a very useful strategy is to capture the structure of the data frames so that you can explore it using your data science skills. One way to do so is with this handy df_types function6 that returns a tibble with one row for each column:\n\ndf_types &lt;- function(df) {\n  tibble(\n    col_name = names(df),\n    col_type = map_chr(df, vctrs::vec_ptype_full),\n    n_miss = map_int(df, \\(x) sum(is.na(x)))\n  )\n}\n\ndf_types(gapminder)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  col_name  col_type  n_miss\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n1 year      double         0\n2 country   character      0\n3 continent character      0\n4 lifeExp   double         0\n5 pop       double         0\n6 gdpPercap double         0\n\n\nYou can then apply this function to all of the files, and maybe do some pivoting to make it easier to see where the differences are. For example, this makes it easy to verify that the gapminder spreadsheets that we’ve been working with are all quite homogeneous:\n\nfiles |&gt;\n  map(df_types) |&gt;\n  list_rbind(names_to = \"file_name\") |&gt;\n  select(-n_miss) |&gt;\n  pivot_wider(names_from = col_name, values_from = col_type)\n\n# A tibble: 12 × 6\n   file_name country   continent lifeExp pop    gdpPercap\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;    \n 1 1952.xlsx character character double  double double   \n 2 1957.xlsx character character double  double double   \n 3 1962.xlsx character character double  double double   \n 4 1967.xlsx character character double  double double   \n 5 1972.xlsx character character double  double double   \n 6 1977.xlsx character character double  double double   \n 7 1982.xlsx character character double  double double   \n 8 1987.xlsx character character double  double double   \n 9 1992.xlsx character character double  double double   \n10 1997.xlsx character character double  double double   \n11 2002.xlsx character character double  double double   \n12 2007.xlsx character character double  double double   \n\n\nIf the files have heterogeneous formats, you might need to do more processing before you can successfully merge them. Unfortunately, we’re now going to leave you to figure that out on your own, but you might want to read about map_if() and map_at(). map_if() allows you to selectively modify elements of a list based on their values; map_at() allows you to selectively modify elements based on their names.\n\n26.3.8 Handling failures\nSometimes the structure of your data might be sufficiently wild that you can’t even read all the files with a single command. And then you’ll encounter one of the downsides of map(): it succeeds or fails as a whole. map() will either successfully read all of the files in a directory or fail with an error, reading zero files. This is annoying: why does one failure prevent you from accessing all the other successes?\nLuckily, purrr comes with a helper to tackle this problem: possibly(). possibly() is what’s known as a function operator: it takes a function and returns a function with modified behavior. In particular, possibly() changes a function from erroring to returning a value that you specify:\n\nfiles &lt;- paths |&gt;\n  map(possibly(\\(path) readxl::read_excel(path), NULL))\n\ndata &lt;- files |&gt; list_rbind()\n\nThis works particularly well here because list_rbind(), like many tidyverse functions, automatically ignores NULLs.\nNow you have all the data that can be read easily, and it’s time to tackle the hard part of figuring out why some files failed to load and what to do about it. Start by getting the paths that failed:\n\nfailed &lt;- map_vec(files, is.null)\npaths[failed]\n\ncharacter(0)\n\n\nThen call the import function again for each failure and figure out what went wrong.",

    "text": "26.4 Saving multiple outputs\nIn the last section, you learned about map(), which is useful for reading multiple files into a single object. In this section, we’ll now explore sort of the opposite problem: how can you take one or more R objects and save it to one or more files? We’ll explore this challenge using three examples:\n\nSaving multiple data frames into one database.\nSaving multiple data frames into multiple .csv files.\nSaving multiple plots to multiple .png files.\n\n\n26.4.1 Writing to a database\nSometimes when working with many files at once, it’s not possible to fit all your data into memory at once, and you can’t do map(files, read_csv). One approach to deal with this problem is to load your data into a database so you can access just the bits you need with dbplyr.\nIf you’re lucky, the database package you’re using will provide a handy function that takes a vector of paths and loads them all into the database. This is the case with duckdb’s duckdb_read_csv():\n\ncon &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())\nduckdb::duckdb_read_csv(con, \"gapminder\", paths)\n\nThis would work well here, but we don’t have csv files, instead we have excel spreadsheets. So we’re going to have to do it “by hand”. Learning to do it by hand will also help you when you have a bunch of csvs and the database that you’re working with doesn’t have one function that will load them all in.\nWe need to start by creating a table that we will fill in with data. The easiest way to do this is by creating a template, a dummy data frame that contains all the columns we want, but only a sampling of the data. For the gapminder data, we can make that template by reading a single file and adding the year to it:\n\ntemplate &lt;- readxl::read_excel(paths[[1]])\ntemplate$year &lt;- 1952\ntemplate\n\n# A tibble: 142 × 6\n   country     continent lifeExp      pop gdpPercap  year\n   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Afghanistan Asia         28.8  8425333      779.  1952\n 2 Albania     Europe       55.2  1282697     1601.  1952\n 3 Algeria     Africa       43.1  9279525     2449.  1952\n 4 Angola      Africa       30.0  4232095     3521.  1952\n 5 Argentina   Americas     62.5 17876956     5911.  1952\n 6 Australia   Oceania      69.1  8691212    10040.  1952\n 7 Austria     Europe       66.8  6927772     6137.  1952\n 8 Bahrain     Asia         50.9   120447     9867.  1952\n 9 Bangladesh  Asia         37.5 46886859      684.  1952\n10 Belgium     Europe       68    8730405     8343.  1952\n# ℹ 132 more rows\n\n\nNow we can connect to the database, and use DBI::dbCreateTable() to turn our template into a database table:\n\ncon &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb())\nDBI::dbCreateTable(con, \"gapminder\", template)\n\ndbCreateTable() doesn’t use the data in template, just the variable names and types. So if we inspect the gapminder table now you’ll see that it’s empty but it has the variables we need with the types we expect:\n\ncon |&gt; tbl(\"gapminder\")\n\n# Source:   table&lt;gapminder&gt; [0 x 6]\n# Database: DuckDB v1.1.0 [unknown@Linux 6.5.0-1025-azure:R 4.4.1/:memory:]\n# ℹ 6 variables: country &lt;chr&gt;, continent &lt;chr&gt;, lifeExp &lt;dbl&gt;, pop &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   gdpPercap &lt;dbl&gt;, year &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nNext, we need a function that takes a single file path, reads it into R, and adds the result to the gapminder table. We can do that by combining read_excel() with DBI::dbAppendTable():\n\nappend_file &lt;- function(path) {\n  df &lt;- readxl::read_excel(path)\n  df$year &lt;- parse_number(basename(path))\n\n  DBI::dbAppendTable(con, \"gapminder\", df)\n}\n\nNow we need to call append_file() once for each element of paths. That’s certainly possible with map():\n\npaths |&gt; map(append_file)\n\nBut we don’t care about the output of append_file(), so instead of map() it’s slightly nicer to use walk(). walk() does exactly the same thing as map() but throws the output away:\n\npaths |&gt; walk(append_file)\n\nNow we can see if we have all the data in our table:\n\ncon |&gt;\n  tbl(\"gapminder\") |&gt;\n  count(year)\n\n# Source:   SQL [?? x 2]\n# Database: DuckDB v1.1.0 [unknown@Linux 6.5.0-1025-azure:R 4.4.1/:memory:]\n    year     n\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  1952   142\n 2  1957   142\n 3  1962   142\n 4  1972   142\n 5  1982   142\n 6  1992   142\n 7  1997   142\n 8  2002   142\n 9  2007   142\n10  1967   142\n# ℹ more rows\n\n\n\n26.4.2 Writing csv files\nThe same basic principle applies if we want to write multiple csv files, one for each group. Let’s imagine that we want to take the ggplot2::diamonds data and save one csv file for each clarity. First we need to make those individual datasets. There are many ways you could do that, but there’s one way we particularly like: group_nest().\n\nby_clarity &lt;- diamonds |&gt;\n  group_nest(clarity)\n\nby_clarity\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 2\n  clarity               data\n  &lt;ord&gt;   &lt;list&lt;tibble[,9]&gt;&gt;\n1 I1               [741 × 9]\n2 SI2            [9,194 × 9]\n3 SI1           [13,065 × 9]\n4 VS2           [12,258 × 9]\n5 VS1            [8,171 × 9]\n6 VVS2           [5,066 × 9]\n7 VVS1           [3,655 × 9]\n8 IF             [1,790 × 9]\n\n\nThis gives us a new tibble with eight rows and two columns. clarity is our grouping variable and data is a list-column containing one tibble for each unique value of clarity:\n\nby_clarity$data[[1]]\n\n# A tibble: 741 × 9\n   carat cut       color depth table price     x     y     z\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;ord&gt;     &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1  0.32 Premium   E      60.9    58   345  4.38  4.42  2.68\n 2  1.17 Very Good J      60.2    61  2774  6.83  6.9   4.13\n 3  1.01 Premium   F      61.8    60  2781  6.39  6.36  3.94\n 4  1.01 Fair      E      64.5    58  2788  6.29  6.21  4.03\n 5  0.96 Ideal     F      60.7    55  2801  6.37  6.41  3.88\n 6  1.04 Premium   G      62.2    58  2801  6.46  6.41  4   \n 7  1    Fair      G      66.4    59  2808  6.16  6.09  4.07\n 8  1.2  Fair      F      64.6    56  2809  6.73  6.66  4.33\n 9  0.43 Very Good E      58.4    62   555  4.94  5     2.9 \n10  1.02 Premium   G      60.3    58  2815  6.55  6.5   3.94\n# ℹ 731 more rows\n\n\nWhile we’re here, let’s create a column that gives the name of output file, using mutate() and str_glue():\n\nby_clarity &lt;- by_clarity |&gt;\n  mutate(path = str_glue(\"diamonds-{clarity}.csv\"))\n\nby_clarity\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  clarity               data path             \n  &lt;ord&gt;   &lt;list&lt;tibble[,9]&gt;&gt; &lt;glue&gt;           \n1 I1               [741 × 9] diamonds-I1.csv  \n2 SI2            [9,194 × 9] diamonds-SI2.csv \n3 SI1           [13,065 × 9] diamonds-SI1.csv \n4 VS2           [12,258 × 9] diamonds-VS2.csv \n5 VS1            [8,171 × 9] diamonds-VS1.csv \n6 VVS2           [5,066 × 9] diamonds-VVS2.csv\n7 VVS1           [3,655 × 9] diamonds-VVS1.csv\n8 IF             [1,790 × 9] diamonds-IF.csv  \n\n\nSo if we were going to save these data frames by hand, we might write something like:\n\nwrite_csv(by_clarity$data[[1]], by_clarity$path[[1]])\nwrite_csv(by_clarity$data[[2]], by_clarity$path[[2]])\nwrite_csv(by_clarity$data[[3]], by_clarity$path[[3]])\n...\nwrite_csv(by_clarity$by_clarity[[8]], by_clarity$path[[8]])\n\nThis is a little different to our previous uses of map() because there are two arguments that are changing, not just one. That means we need a new function: map2(), which varies both the first and second arguments. And because we again don’t care about the output, we want walk2() rather than map2(). That gives us:\n\nwalk2(by_clarity$data, by_clarity$path, write_csv)\n\n\n26.4.3 Saving plots\nWe can take the same basic approach to create many plots. Let’s first make a function that draws the plot we want:\n\ncarat_histogram &lt;- function(df) {\n  ggplot(df, aes(x = carat)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)\n}\n\ncarat_histogram(by_clarity$data[[1]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can use map() to create a list of many plots7 and their eventual file paths:\n\nby_clarity &lt;- by_clarity |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    plot = map(data, carat_histogram),\n    path = str_glue(\"clarity-{clarity}.png\")\n  )\n\nThen use walk2() with ggsave() to save each plot:\n\nwalk2(\n  by_clarity$path,\n  by_clarity$plot,\n  \\(path, plot) ggsave(path, plot, width = 6, height = 6)\n)\n\nThis is shorthand for:\n\nggsave(by_clarity$path[[1]], by_clarity$plot[[1]], width = 6, height = 6)\nggsave(by_clarity$path[[2]], by_clarity$plot[[2]], width = 6, height = 6)\nggsave(by_clarity$path[[3]], by_clarity$plot[[3]], width = 6, height = 6)\n...\nggsave(by_clarity$path[[8]], by_clarity$plot[[8]], width = 6, height = 6)",

But in general, iteration is a super power: if you know the right iteration technique, you can easily go from fixing one problem to fixing all the problems. Once you’ve mastered the techniques in this chapter, we highly recommend learning more by reading the Functionals chapter of Advanced R and consulting the purrr website.\nIf you know much about iteration in other languages, you might be surprised that we didn’t discuss the for loop. That’s because R’s orientation towards data analysis changes how we iterate: in most cases you can rely on an existing idiom to do something to each columns or each group. And when you can’t, you can often use a functional programming tool like map() that does something to each element of a list. However, you will see for loops in wild-caught code, so you’ll learn about them in the next chapter where we’ll discuss some important base R tools.",

    "text": "27.1 Introduction\nTo finish off the programming section, we’re going to give you a quick tour of the most important base R functions that we don’t otherwise discuss in the book. These tools are particularly useful as you do more programming and will help you read code you’ll encounter in the wild.\nThis is a good place to remind you that the tidyverse is not the only way to solve data science problems. We teach the tidyverse in this book because tidyverse packages share a common design philosophy, increasing the consistency across functions, and making each new function or package a little easier to learn and use. It’s not possible to use the tidyverse without using base R, so we’ve actually already taught you a lot of base R functions: from library() to load packages, to sum() and mean() for numeric summaries, to the factor, date, and POSIXct data types, and of course all the basic operators like +, -, /, *, |, &, and !. What we haven’t focused on so far is base R workflows, so we will highlight a few of those in this chapter.\nAfter you read this book, you’ll learn other approaches to the same problems using base R, data.table, and other packages. You’ll undoubtedly encounter these other approaches when you start reading R code written by others, particularly if you’re using StackOverflow. It’s 100% okay to write code that uses a mix of approaches, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise!\nIn this chapter, we’ll focus on four big topics: subsetting with [, subsetting with [[ and $, the apply family of functions, and for loops.

    "text": "27.2 Selecting multiple elements with [\n\n[ is used to extract sub-components from vectors and data frames, and is called like x[i] or x[i, j]. In this section, we’ll introduce you to the power of [, first showing you how you can use it with vectors, then how the same principles extend in a straightforward way to two-dimensional (2d) structures like data frames. We’ll then help you cement that knowledge by showing how various dplyr verbs are special cases of [.\n\n27.2.1 Subsetting vectors\nThere are five main types of things that you can subset a vector with, i.e., that can be the i in x[i]:\n\n\nA vector of positive integers. Subsetting with positive integers keeps the elements at those positions:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBy repeating a position, you can actually make a longer output than input, making the term “subsetting” a bit of a misnomer.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nA vector of negative integers. Negative values drop the elements at the specified positions:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nA logical vector. Subsetting with a logical vector keeps all values corresponding to a TRUE value. This is most often useful in conjunction with the comparison functions.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUnlike filter(), NA indices will be included in the output as NAs.\n\n\nA character vector. If you have a named vector, you can subset it with a character vector:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAs with subsetting with positive integers, you can use a character vector to duplicate individual entries.\n\nNothing. The final type of subsetting is nothing, x[], which returns the complete x. This is not useful for subsetting vectors, but as we’ll see shortly, it is useful when subsetting 2d structures like tibbles.\n\n27.2.2 Subsetting data frames\nThere are quite a few different ways1 that you can use [ with a data frame, but the most important way is to select rows and columns independently with df[rows, cols]. Here rows and cols are vectors as described above. For example, df[rows, ] and df[, cols] select just rows or just columns, using the empty subset to preserve the other dimension.\nHere are a couple of examples:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe’ll come back to $ shortly, but you should be able to guess what df$x does from the context: it extracts the x variable from df. We need to use it here because [ doesn’t use tidy evaluation, so you need to be explicit about the source of the x variable.\nThere’s an important difference between tibbles and data frames when it comes to [. In this book, we’ve mainly used tibbles, which are data frames, but they tweak some behaviors to make your life a little easier. In most places, you can use “tibble” and “data frame” interchangeably, so when we want to draw particular attention to R’s built-in data frame, we’ll write data.frame. If df is a data.frame, then df[, cols] will return a vector if col selects a single column and a data frame if it selects more than one column. If df is a tibble, then [ will always return a tibble.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOne way to avoid this ambiguity with data.frames is to explicitly specify drop = FALSE:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n27.2.3 dplyr equivalents\nSeveral dplyr verbs are special cases of [:\n\n\nfilter() is equivalent to subsetting the rows with a logical vector, taking care to exclude missing values:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAnother common technique in the wild is to use which() for its side-effect of dropping missing values: df[which(df$x &gt; 1), ].\n\n\narrange() is equivalent to subsetting the rows with an integer vector, usually created with order():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou can use order(decreasing = TRUE) to sort all columns in descending order or -rank(col) to sort columns in decreasing order individually.\n\n\nBoth select() and relocate() are similar to subsetting the columns with a character vector:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nBase R also provides a function that combines the features of filter() and select()2 called subset():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis function was the inspiration for much of dplyr’s syntax.\n\n27.2.4 Exercises\n\n\nCreate functions that take a vector as input and return:\n\nThe elements at even-numbered positions.\nEvery element except the last value.\nOnly even values (and no missing values).\n\n\nWhy is x[-which(x &gt; 0)] not the same as x[x &lt;= 0]?

[[ can access by position or by name, and $ is specialized for access by name:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThey can also be used to create new columns, the base R equivalent of mutate():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThere are several other base R approaches to creating new columns including with transform(), with(), and within().

That means we could rewrite the above code to use the pipe:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n27.3.2 Tibbles\nThere are a couple of important differences between tibbles and base data.frames when it comes to $. Data frames match the prefix of any variable names (so-called partial matching) and don’t complain if a column doesn’t exist:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nTibbles are more strict: they only ever match variable names exactly and they will generate a warning if the column you are trying to access doesn’t exist:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFor this reason we sometimes joke that tibbles are lazy and surly: they do less and complain more.\n\n27.3.3 Lists\n[[ and $ are also really important for working with lists, and it’s important to understand how they differ from [. Let’s illustrate the differences with a list named l:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n[ extracts a sub-list. It doesn’t matter how many elements you extract, the result will always be a list.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nLike with vectors, you can subset with a logical, integer, or character vector.\n\n\n[[ and $ extract a single component from a list. They remove a level of hierarchy from the list.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nThe difference between [ and [[ is particularly important for lists because [[ drills down into the list while [ returns a new, smaller list. To help you remember the difference, take a look at the unusual pepper shaker shown in Figure 27.1. If this pepper shaker is your list pepper, then, pepper[1] is a pepper shaker containing a single pepper packet. pepper[2] would look the same, but would contain the second packet. pepper[1:2] would be a pepper shaker containing two pepper packets. pepper[[1]] would extract the pepper packet itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 27.1: (Left) A pepper shaker that Hadley once found in his hotel room. (Middle) pepper[1]. (Right) pepper[[1]]\n\n\n\n\nThis same principle applies when you use 1d [ with a data frame: df[\"x\"] returns a one-column data frame and df[[\"x\"]] returns a vector.\n\n27.3.4 Exercises\n\nWhat happens when you use [[ with a positive integer that’s bigger than the length of the vector? What happens when you subset with a name that doesn’t exist?\nWhat would pepper[[1]][1] be? What about pepper[[1]][[1]]?",

    "text": "27.4 Apply family\nIn Chapter 26, you learned tidyverse techniques for iteration like dplyr::across() and the map family of functions. In this section, you’ll learn about their base equivalents, the apply family. In this context apply and map are synonyms because another way of saying “map a function over each element of a vector” is “apply a function over each element of a vector”. Here we’ll give you a quick overview of this family so you can recognize them in the wild.\nThe most important member of this family is lapply(), which is very similar to purrr::map()3. In fact, because we haven’t used any of map()’s more advanced features, you can replace every map() call in Chapter 26 with lapply().\nThere’s no exact base R equivalent to across() but you can get close by using [ with lapply(). This works because under the hood, data frames are lists of columns, so calling lapply() on a data frame applies the function to each column.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe code above uses a new function, sapply(). It’s similar to lapply() but it always tries to simplify the result, hence the s in its name, here producing a logical vector instead of a list. We don’t recommend using it for programming, because the simplification can fail and give you an unexpected type, but it’s usually fine for interactive use. purrr has a similar function called map_vec() that we didn’t mention in Chapter 26.\nBase R provides a stricter version of sapply() called vapply(), short for vector apply. It takes an additional argument that specifies the expected type, ensuring that simplification occurs the same way regardless of the input. For example, we could replace the sapply() call above with this vapply() where we specify that we expect is.numeric() to return a logical vector of length 1:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe distinction between sapply() and vapply() is really important when they’re inside a function (because it makes a big difference to the function’s robustness to unusual inputs), but it doesn’t usually matter in data analysis.\nAnother important member of the apply family is tapply() which computes a single grouped summary:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUnfortunately tapply() returns its results in a named vector which requires some gymnastics if you want to collect multiple summaries and grouping variables into a data frame (it’s certainly possible to not do this and just work with free floating vectors, but in our experience that just delays the work). If you want to see how you might use tapply() or other base techniques to perform other grouped summaries, Hadley has collected a few techniques in a gist.\nThe final member of the apply family is the titular apply(), which works with matrices and arrays. In particular, watch out for apply(df, 2, something), which is a slow and potentially dangerous way of doing lapply(df, something). This rarely comes up in data science because we usually work with data frames and not matrices.",

This is the source of the persistent canard that for loops are slow: they’re not, but iteratively growing a vector is.",

Compared to approaches discussed elsewhere in the book, these functions tend to have more of a “vector” flavor than a “data frame” flavor because base R functions tend to take individual vectors, rather than a data frame and some column specification. This often makes life easier for programming and so becomes more important as you write more functions and begin to write your own packages.\nThis chapter concludes the programming section of the book. You’ve made a solid start on your journey to becoming not just a data scientist who uses R, but a data scientist who can program in R.

This means that help is, by-and-large, not available through ?. Instead, as you work through this chapter, and use Quarto in the future, you should refer to the Quarto documentation.\nIf you’re an R Markdown user, you might be thinking “Quarto sounds a lot like R Markdown”. You’re not wrong! Quarto unifies the functionality of many packages from the R Markdown ecosystem (rmarkdown, bookdown, distill, xaringan, etc.) into a single consistent system as well as extends it with native support for multiple programming languages like Python and Julia in addition to R.

    "section": "\n28.3 Visual editor",
    "text": "28.3 Visual editor\nThe Visual editor in RStudio provides a WYSIWYM interface for authoring Quarto documents. Under the hood, prose in Quarto documents (.qmd files) is written in Markdown, a lightweight set of conventions for formatting plain text files. In fact, Quarto uses Pandoc markdown (a slightly extended version of Markdown that Quarto understands), including tables, citations, cross-references, footnotes, divs/spans, definition lists, attributes, raw HTML/TeX, and more as well as support for executing code cells and viewing their output inline. While Markdown is designed to be easy to read and write, as you will see in Section 28.4, it still requires learning new syntax. Therefore, if you’re new to computational documents like .qmd files but have experience using tools like Google Docs or MS Word, the easiest way to get started with Quarto in RStudio is the visual editor.\nIn the visual editor you can either use the buttons on the menu bar to insert images, tables, cross-references, etc. or you can use the catch-all ⌘ + / or Ctrl + / shortcut to insert just about anything. If you are at the beginning of a line (as shown in Figure 28.5), you can also enter just / to invoke the shortcut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 28.5: Quarto visual editor.\n\n\n\n\nInserting images and customizing how they are displayed is also facilitated with the visual editor. You can either paste an image from your clipboard directly into the visual editor (and RStudio will place a copy of that image in the project directory and link to it) or you can use the visual editor’s Insert &gt; Figure / Image menu to browse to the image you want to insert or paste it’s URL. In addition, using the same menu you can resize the image as well as add a caption, alternative text, and a link.\nThe visual editor has many more features that we haven’t enumerated here that you might find useful as you gain experience authoring with it.\nMost importantly, while the visual editor displays your content with formatting, under the hood, it saves your content in plain Markdown and you can switch back and forth between the visual and source editors to view and edit your content using either tool.\n\n28.3.1 Exercises\n\nRe-create the document in Figure 28.5 using the visual editor.\nUsing the visual editor, insert a code chunk using the Insert menu and then the insert anything tool.\nUsing the visual editor, figure out how to:\n\nAdd a footnote.\nAdd a horizontal rule.\nAdd a block quote.\n\n\nIn the visual editor, go to Insert &gt; Citation and insert a citation to the paper titled Welcome to the Tidyverse using its DOI (digital object identifier), which is 10.21105/joss.01686. Render the document and observe how the reference shows up in the document. What change do you observe in the YAML of your document?",

    "section": "\n28.5 Code chunks",
    "text": "28.5 Code chunks\nTo run code inside a Quarto document, you need to insert a chunk. There are three ways to do so:\n\nThe keyboard shortcut Cmd + Option + I / Ctrl + Alt + I.\nThe “Insert” button icon in the editor toolbar.\nBy manually typing the chunk delimiters ```{r} and ```.\n\nWe’d recommend you learn the keyboard shortcut. It will save you a lot of time in the long run!\nYou can continue to run the code using the keyboard shortcut that by now (we hope!) you know and love: Cmd/Ctrl + Enter. However, chunks get a new keyboard shortcut: Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter, which runs all the code in the chunk. Think of a chunk like a function. A chunk should be relatively self-contained, and focused around a single task.\nThe following sections describe the chunk header which consists of ```{r}, followed by an optional chunk label and various other chunk options, each on their own line, marked by #|.\n\n28.5.1 Chunk label\nChunks can be given an optional label, e.g.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: simple-addition\n\n1 + 1\n```\n#&gt; [1] 2\n\nThis has three advantages:\n\n\nYou can more easily navigate to specific chunks using the drop-down code navigator in the bottom-left of the script editor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGraphics produced by the chunks will have useful names that make them easier to use elsewhere. More on that in Section 28.6.\nYou can set up networks of cached chunks to avoid re-performing expensive computations on every run. More on that in Section 28.8.\n\nYour chunk labels should be short but evocative and should not contain spaces. We recommend using dashes (-) to separate words (instead of underscores, _) and avoiding other special characters in chunk labels.\nYou are generally free to label your chunk however you like, but there is one chunk name that imbues special behavior: setup. When you’re in a notebook mode, the chunk named setup will be run automatically once, before any other code is run.\nAdditionally, chunk labels cannot be duplicated. Each chunk label must be unique.\n\n28.5.2 Chunk options\nChunk output can be customized with options, fields supplied to chunk header. Knitr provides almost 60 options that you can use to customize your code chunks. Here we’ll cover the most important chunk options that you’ll use frequently. You can see the full list at https://yihui.org/knitr/options.\nThe most important set of options controls if your code block is executed and what results are inserted in the finished report:\n\neval: false prevents code from being evaluated. (And obviously if the code is not run, no results will be generated). This is useful for displaying example code, or for disabling a large block of code without commenting each line.\ninclude: false runs the code, but doesn’t show the code or results in the final document. Use this for setup code that you don’t want cluttering your report.\necho: false prevents code, but not the results from appearing in the finished file. Use this when writing reports aimed at people who don’t want to see the underlying R code.\nmessage: false or warning: false prevents messages or warnings from appearing in the finished file.\nresults: hide hides printed output; fig-show: hide hides plots.\nerror: true causes the render to continue even if code returns an error. This is rarely something you’ll want to include in the final version of your report, but can be very useful if you need to debug exactly what is going on inside your .qmd. It’s also useful if you’re teaching R and want to deliberately include an error. The default, error: false causes rendering to fail if there is a single error in the document.\n\nEach of these chunk options get added to the header of the chunk, following #|, e.g., in the following chunk the result is not printed since eval is set to false.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: simple-multiplication\n#| eval: false\n\n2 * 2\n```\n\nThe following table summarizes which types of output each option suppresses:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nRun code\nShow code\nOutput\nPlots\nMessages\nWarnings\n\n\n\neval: false\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\ninclude: false\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\necho: false\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresults: hide\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nfig-show: hide\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nmessage: false\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nwarning: false\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n28.5.3 Global options\nAs you work more with knitr, you will discover that some of the default chunk options don’t fit your needs and you want to change them.\nYou can do this by adding the preferred options in the document YAML, under execute. For example, if you are preparing a report for an audience who does not need to see your code but only your results and narrative, you might set echo: false at the document level. That will hide the code by default, so only showing the chunks you deliberately choose to show (with echo: true). You might consider setting message: false and warning: false, but that would make it harder to debug problems because you wouldn’t see any messages in the final document.\ntitle: \"My report\"\nexecute:\n  echo: false\nSince Quarto is designed to be multi-lingual (works with R as well as other languages like Python, Julia, etc.), all of the knitr options are not available at the document execution level since some of them only work with knitr and not other engines Quarto uses for running code in other languages (e.g., Jupyter). You can, however, still set these as global options for your document under the knitr field, under opts_chunk. For example, when writing books and tutorials we set:\ntitle: \"Tutorial\"\nknitr:\n  opts_chunk:\n    comment: \"#&gt;\"\n    collapse: true\nThis uses our preferred comment formatting and ensures that the code and output are kept closely entwined.\n\n28.5.4 Inline code\nThere is one other way to embed R code into a Quarto document: directly into the text, with: `r `. This can be very useful if you mention properties of your data in the text. For example, the example document used at the start of the chapter had:\n\nWe have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only `r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than 2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:\n\nWhen the report is rendered, the results of these computations are inserted into the text:\n\nWe have data about 53940 diamonds. Only 126 are larger than 2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:\n\nWhen inserting numbers into text, format() is your friend. It allows you to set the number of digits so you don’t print to a ridiculous degree of precision, and a big.mark to make numbers easier to read. You might combine these into a helper function:\n\ncomma &lt;- function(x) format(x, digits = 2, big.mark = \",\")\ncomma(3452345)\n#&gt; [1] \"3,452,345\"\ncomma(.12358124331)\n#&gt; [1] \"0.12\"\n\n\n28.5.5 Exercises\n\nAdd a section that explores how diamond sizes vary by cut, color, and clarity. Assume you’re writing a report for someone who doesn’t know R, and instead of setting echo: false on each chunk, set a global option.\nDownload diamond-sizes.qmd from https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/tree/main/quarto. Add a section that describes the largest 20 diamonds, including a table that displays their most important attributes.\nModify diamonds-sizes.qmd to use label_comma() to produce nicely formatted output. Also include the percentage of diamonds that are larger than 2.5 carats.",

    "section": "\n28.6 Figures",
    "text": "28.6 Figures\nThe figures in a Quarto document can be embedded (e.g., a PNG or JPEG file) or generated as a result of a code chunk.\nTo embed an image from an external file, you can use the Insert menu in the Visual Editor in RStudio and select Figure / Image. This will pop open a menu where you can browse to the image you want to insert as well as add alternative text or caption to it and adjust its size. In the visual editor you can also simply paste an image from your clipboard into your document and RStudio will place a copy of that image in your project folder.\nIf you include a code chunk that generates a figure (e.g., includes a ggplot() call), the resulting figure will be automatically included in your Quarto document.\n\n28.6.1 Figure sizing\nThe biggest challenge of graphics in Quarto is getting your figures the right size and shape. There are five main options that control figure sizing: fig-width, fig-height, fig-asp, out-width and out-height. Image sizing is challenging because there are two sizes (the size of the figure created by R and the size at which it is inserted in the output document), and multiple ways of specifying the size (i.e. height, width, and aspect ratio: pick two of three).\nWe recommend three of the five options:\n\nPlots tend to be more aesthetically pleasing if they have consistent width. To enforce this, set fig-width: 6 (6”) and fig-asp: 0.618 (the golden ratio) in the defaults. Then in individual chunks, only adjust fig-asp.\n\nControl the output size with out-width and set it to a percentage of the body width of the output document. We suggest to out-width: \"70%\" and fig-align: center.\nThat gives plots room to breathe, without taking up too much space.\n\nTo put multiple plots in a single row, set the layout-ncol to 2 for two plots, 3 for three plots, etc. This effectively sets out-width to “50%” for each of your plots if layout-ncol is 2, “33%” if layout-ncol is 3, etc. Depending on what you’re trying to illustrate (e.g., show data or show plot variations), you might also tweak fig-width, as discussed below.\n\nIf you find that you’re having to squint to read the text in your plot, you need to tweak fig-width. If fig-width is larger than the size the figure is rendered in the final doc, the text will be too small; if fig-width is smaller, the text will be too big. You’ll often need to do a little experimentation to figure out the right ratio between the fig-width and the eventual width in your document. To illustrate the principle, the following three plots have fig-width of 4, 6, and 8 respectively:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to make sure the font size is consistent across all your figures, whenever you set out-width, you’ll also need to adjust fig-width to maintain the same ratio with your default out-width. For example, if your default fig-width is 6 and out-width is “70%”, when you set out-width: \"50%\" you’ll need to set fig-width to 4.3 (6 * 0.5 / 0.7).\nFigure sizing and scaling is an art and science and getting things right can require an iterative trial-and-error approach. You can learn more about figure sizing in the taking control of plot scaling blog post.\n\n28.6.2 Other important options\nWhen mingling code and text, like in this book, you can set fig-show: hold so that plots are shown after the code. This has the pleasant side effect of forcing you to break up large blocks of code with their explanations.\nTo add a caption to the plot, use fig-cap. In Quarto this will change the figure from inline to “floating”.\nIf you’re producing PDF output, the default graphics type is PDF. This is a good default because PDFs are high quality vector graphics. However, they can produce very large and slow plots if you are displaying thousands of points. In that case, set fig-format: \"png\" to force the use of PNGs. They are slightly lower quality, but will be much more compact.\nIt’s a good idea to name code chunks that produce figures, even if you don’t routinely label other chunks. The chunk label is used to generate the file name of the graphic on disk, so naming your chunks makes it much easier to pick out plots and reuse in other circumstances (e.g., if you want to quickly drop a single plot into an email).\n\n28.6.3 Exercises\n\nOpen diamond-sizes.qmd in the visual editor, find an image of a diamond, copy it, and paste it into the document. Double click on the image and add a caption. Resize the image and render your document. Observe how the image is saved in your current working directory.\nEdit the label of the code chunk in diamond-sizes.qmd that generates a plot to start with the prefix fig- and add a caption to the figure with the chunk option fig-cap. Then, edit the text above the code chunk to add a cross-reference to the figure with Insert &gt; Cross Reference.\nChange the size of the figure with the following chunk options, one at a time, render your document, and describe how the figure changes.\n\nfig-width: 10\nfig-height: 3\nout-width: \"100%\"\nout-width: \"20%\"",

They can be markdown tables that you create directly in your Quarto document (using the Insert Table menu) or they can be tables generated as a result of a code chunk. In this section we will focus on the latter, tables generated via computation.\nBy default, Quarto prints data frames and matrices as you’d see them in the console:\n\nmtcars[1:5, ]\n#&gt;                    mpg cyl disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\n#&gt; Mazda RX4         21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\n#&gt; Mazda RX4 Wag     21.0   6  160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\n#&gt; Datsun 710        22.8   4  108  93 3.85 2.320 18.61  1  1    4    1\n#&gt; Hornet 4 Drive    21.4   6  258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\n#&gt; Hornet Sportabout 18.7   8  360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02  0  0    3    2\n\nIf you prefer that data be displayed with additional formatting you can use the knitr::kable() function.

    "section": "\n28.8 Caching",
    "text": "28.8 Caching\nNormally, each render of a document starts from a completely clean slate. This is great for reproducibility, because it ensures that you’ve captured every important computation in code. However, it can be painful if you have some computations that take a long time. The solution is cache: true.\nYou can enable the Knitr cache at the document level for caching the results of all computations in a document using standard YAML options:\n---\ntitle: \"My Document\"\nexecute: \n  cache: true\n---\nYou can also enable caching at the chunk level for caching the results of computation in a specific chunk:\n\n```{r}\n#| cache: true\n\n# code for lengthy computation...\n```\n\nWhen set, this will save the output of the chunk to a specially named file on disk. On subsequent runs, knitr will check to see if the code has changed, and if it hasn’t, it will reuse the cached results.\nThe caching system must be used with care, because by default it is based on the code only, not its dependencies. For example, here the processed_data chunk depends on the raw-data chunk:\n```{r}\n#| label: raw-data\n#| cache: true\n\nrawdata &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"a_very_large_file.csv\")\n```\n```{r}\n#| label: processed_data\n#| cache: true\n\nprocessed_data &lt;- rawdata |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(import_var)) |&gt; \n  mutate(new_variable = complicated_transformation(x, y, z))\n```\nCaching the processed_data chunk means that it will get re-run if the dplyr pipeline is changed, but it won’t get rerun if the read_csv() call changes. You can avoid that problem with the dependson chunk option:\n```{r}\n#| label: processed-data\n#| cache: true\n#| dependson: \"raw-data\"\n\nprocessed_data &lt;- rawdata |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(import_var)) |&gt; \n  mutate(new_variable = complicated_transformation(x, y, z))\n```\ndependson should contain a character vector of every chunk that the cached chunk depends on. Knitr will update the results for the cached chunk whenever it detects that one of its dependencies have changed.\nNote that the chunks won’t update if a_very_large_file.csv changes, because knitr caching only tracks changes within the .qmd file. If you want to also track changes to that file you can use the cache.extra option. This is an arbitrary R expression that will invalidate the cache whenever it changes. A good function to use is file.mtime(): it returns when it was last modified. Then you can write:\n```{r}\n#| label: raw-data\n#| cache: true\n#| cache.extra: !expr file.mtime(\"a_very_large_file.csv\")\n\nrawdata &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"a_very_large_file.csv\")\n```\nWe’ve followed the advice of David Robinson to name these chunks: each chunk is named after the primary object that it creates. This makes it easier to understand the dependson specification.\nAs your caching strategies get progressively more complicated, it’s a good idea to regularly clear out all your caches with knitr::clean_cache().\n\n28.8.1 Exercises\n\nSet up a network of chunks where d depends on c and b, and both b and c depend on a. Have each chunk print lubridate::now(), set cache: true, then verify your understanding of caching.",

    "text": "28.9 Troubleshooting\nTroubleshooting Quarto documents can be challenging because you are no longer in an interactive R environment, and you will need to learn some new tricks. Additionally, the error could be due to issues with the Quarto document itself or due to the R code in the Quarto document.\nOne common error in documents with code chunks is duplicated chunk labels, which are especially pervasive if your workflow involves copying and pasting code chunks. To address this issue, all you need to do is to change one of your duplicated labels.\nIf the errors are due to the R code in the document, the first thing you should always try is to recreate the problem in an interactive session. Restart R, then “Run all chunks”, either from the Code menu, under Run region or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + R. If you’re lucky, that will recreate the problem, and you can figure out what’s going on interactively.\nIf that doesn’t help, there must be something different between your interactive environment and the Quarto environment. You’re going to need to systematically explore the options. The most common difference is the working directory: the working directory of a Quarto is the directory in which it lives. Check the working directory is what you expect by including getwd() in a chunk.\nNext, brainstorm all the things that might cause the bug. You’ll need to systematically check that they’re the same in your R session and your Quarto session. The easiest way to do that is to set error: true on the chunk causing the problem, then use print() and str() to check that settings are as you expect.",

    "title": "28  Quarto",
    "section": "\n28.10 YAML header",
    "text": "28.10 YAML header\nYou can control many other “whole document” settings by tweaking the parameters of the YAML header. You might wonder what YAML stands for: it’s “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”, which is designed for representing hierarchical data in a way that’s easy for humans to read and write. Quarto uses it to control many details of the output. Here we’ll discuss three: self-contained documents, document parameters, and bibliographies.\n\n28.10.1 Self-contained\nHTML documents typically have a number of external dependencies (e.g., images, CSS style sheets, JavaScript, etc.) and, by default, Quarto places these dependencies in a _files folder in the same directory as your .qmd file. If you publish the HTML file on a hosting platform (e.g., QuartoPub, https://quartopub.com/), the dependencies in this directory are published with your document and hence are available in the published report. However, if you want to email the report to a colleague, you might prefer to have a single, self-contained, HTML document that embeds all of its dependencies. You can do this by specifying the embed-resources option:\nformat:\n  html:\n    embed-resources: true\nThe resulting file will be self-contained, such that it will need no external files and no internet access to be displayed properly by a browser.\n\n28.10.2 Parameters\nQuarto documents can include one or more parameters whose values can be set when you render the report. Parameters are useful when you want to re-render the same report with distinct values for various key inputs. For example, you might be producing sales reports per branch, exam results by student, or demographic summaries by country. To declare one or more parameters, use the params field.\nThis example uses a my_class parameter to determine which class of cars to display:\n\n---\nformat: html\nparams:\n  my_class: \"suv\"\n---\n\n```{r}\n#| label: setup\n#| include: false\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nclass &lt;- mpg |&gt; filter(class == params$my_class)\n```\n\n# Fuel economy for `r params$my_class`s\n\n```{r}\n#| message: false\n\nggplot(class, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)\n```\n\nAs you can see, parameters are available within the code chunks as a read-only list named params.\nYou can write atomic vectors directly into the YAML header. You can also run arbitrary R expressions by prefacing the parameter value with !expr. This is a good way to specify date/time parameters.\nparams:\n  start: !expr lubridate::ymd(\"2015-01-01\")\n  snapshot: !expr lubridate::ymd_hms(\"2015-01-01 12:30:00\")\n\n28.10.3 Bibliographies and Citations\nQuarto can automatically generate citations and a bibliography in a number of styles. The most straightforward way of adding citations and bibliographies to a Quarto document is using the visual editor in RStudio.\nTo add a citation using the visual editor, go to Insert &gt; Citation. Citations can be inserted from a variety of sources:\n\nDOI (Document Object Identifier) references.\nZotero personal or group libraries.\nSearches of Crossref, DataCite, or PubMed.\nYour document bibliography (a .bib file in the directory of your document)\n\nUnder the hood, the visual mode uses the standard Pandoc markdown representation for citations (e.g., [@citation]).\nIf you add a citation using one of the first three methods, the visual editor will automatically create a bibliography.bib file for you and add the reference to it. It will also add a bibliography field to the document YAML. As you add more references, this file will get populated with their citations. You can also directly edit this file using many common bibliography formats including BibLaTeX, BibTeX, EndNote, Medline.\nTo create a citation within your .qmd file in the source editor, use a key composed of ‘@’ + the citation identifier from the bibliography file. Then place the citation in square brackets. Here are some examples:\nSeparate multiple citations with a `;`: Blah blah [@smith04; @doe99].\n\nYou can add arbitrary comments inside the square brackets: \nBlah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35; also @smith04, ch. 1].\n\nRemove the square brackets to create an in-text citation: @smith04 \nsays blah, or @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.\n\nAdd a `-` before the citation to suppress the author's name: \nSmith says blah [-@smith04].\nWhen Quarto renders your file, it will build and append a bibliography to the end of your document. The bibliography will contain each of the cited references from your bibliography file, but it will not contain a section heading. As a result it is common practice to end your file with a section header for the bibliography, such as # References or # Bibliography.\nYou can change the style of your citations and bibliography by referencing a CSL (citation style language) file in the csl field:\nbibliography: rmarkdown.bib\ncsl: apa.csl\nAs with the bibliography field, your csl file should contain a path to the file. Here we assume that the csl file is in the same directory as the .qmd file. A good place to find CSL style files for common bibliography styles is https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles.",

    "section": "\n28.11 Workflow",
    "text": "28.11 Workflow\nEarlier, we discussed a basic workflow for capturing your R code where you work interactively in the console, then capture what works in the script editor. Quarto brings together the console and the script editor, blurring the lines between interactive exploration and long-term code capture. You can rapidly iterate within a chunk, editing and re-executing with Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Enter. When you’re happy, you move on and start a new chunk.\nQuarto is also important because it so tightly integrates prose and code. This makes it a great analysis notebook because it lets you develop code and record your thoughts. An analysis notebook shares many of the same goals as a classic lab notebook in the physical sciences. It:\n\nRecords what you did and why you did it. Regardless of how great your memory is, if you don’t record what you do, there will come a time when you have forgotten important details. Write them down so you don’t forget!\nSupports rigorous thinking. You are more likely to come up with a strong analysis if you record your thoughts as you go, and continue to reflect on them. This also saves you time when you eventually write up your analysis to share with others.\nHelps others understand your work. It is rare to do data analysis by yourself, and you’ll often be working as part of a team. A lab notebook helps you share not only what you’ve done, but why you did it with your colleagues or lab mates.\n\nMuch of the good advice about using lab notebooks effectively can also be translated to analysis notebooks. We’ve drawn on our own experiences and Colin Purrington’s advice on lab notebooks (https://colinpurrington.com/tips/lab-notebooks) to come up with the following tips:\n\nEnsure each notebook has a descriptive title, an evocative file name, and a first paragraph that briefly describes the aims of the analysis.\n\nUse the YAML header date field to record the date you started working on the notebook:\ndate: 2016-08-23\nUse ISO8601 YYYY-MM-DD format so that’s there no ambiguity. Use it even if you don’t normally write dates that way!\n\nIf you spend a lot of time on an analysis idea and it turns out to be a dead end, don’t delete it! Write up a brief note about why it failed and leave it in the notebook. That will help you avoid going down the same dead end when you come back to the analysis in the future.\nGenerally, you’re better off doing data entry outside of R. But if you do need to record a small snippet of data, clearly lay it out using tibble::tribble().\nIf you discover an error in a data file, never modify it directly, but instead write code to correct the value. Explain why you made the fix.\nBefore you finish for the day, make sure you can render the notebook. If you’re using caching, make sure to clear the caches. That will let you fix any problems while the code is still fresh in your mind.\nIf you want your code to be reproducible in the long-run (i.e. so you can come back to run it next month or next year), you’ll need to track the versions of the packages that your code uses. A rigorous approach is to use renv, https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html, which stores packages in your project directory. A quick and dirty hack is to include a chunk that runs sessionInfo() — that won’t let you easily recreate your packages as they are today, but at least you’ll know what they were.\nYou are going to create many, many, many analysis notebooks over the course of your career. How are you going to organize them so you can find them again in the future? We recommend storing them in individual projects, and coming up with a good naming scheme.",

You’ve learned about writing Quarto documents in RStudio with the visual or the source editor, how code chunks work and how to customize options for them, how to include figures and tables in your Quarto documents, and options for caching for computations. Additionally, you’ve learned about adjusting YAML header options for creating self-contained or parametrized documents as well as including citations and bibliography. We have also given you some troubleshooting and workflow tips.\nWhile this introduction should be sufficient to get you started with Quarto, there is still a lot more to learn. Quarto is still relatively young, and is still growing rapidly. The best place to stay on top of innovations is the official Quarto website: https://quarto.org.\nThere are two important topics that we haven’t covered here: collaboration and the details of accurately communicating your ideas to other humans. Collaboration is a vital part of modern data science, and you can make your life much easier by using version control tools, like Git and GitHub. We recommend “Happy Git with R”, a user friendly introduction to Git and GitHub from R users, by Jenny Bryan. The book is freely available online: https://happygitwithr.com.\nWe have also not touched on what you should actually write in order to clearly communicate the results of your analysis. To improve your writing, we highly recommend reading either Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace by Joseph M. Williams & Joseph Bizup, or The Sense of Structure: Writing from the Reader’s Perspective by George Gopen. Both books will help you understand the structure of sentences and paragraphs, and give you the tools to make your writing more clear. (These books are rather expensive if purchased new, but they’re used by many English classes so there are plenty of cheap second-hand copies). George Gopen also has a number of short articles on writing at https://www.georgegopen.com/litigation-articles.html. They are aimed at lawyers, but almost everything applies to data scientists too.",

    "text": "29.5 Interactivity\nJust like any HTML document, HTML documents created with Quarto can contain interactive components as well. Here we introduce two options for including interactivity in your Quarto documents: htmlwidgets and Shiny.\n\n29.5.1 htmlwidgets\nHTML is an interactive format, and you can take advantage of that interactivity with htmlwidgets, R functions that produce interactive HTML visualizations. For example, take the leaflet map below. If you’re viewing this page on the web, you can drag the map around, zoom in and out, etc. You obviously can’t do that in a book, so Quarto automatically inserts a static screenshot for you.\n\nlibrary(leaflet)\nleaflet() |&gt;\n  setView(174.764, -36.877, zoom = 16) |&gt; \n  addTiles() |&gt;\n  addMarkers(174.764, -36.877, popup = \"Maungawhau\") \n\n\n\n\n\nThe great thing about htmlwidgets is that you don’t need to know anything about HTML or JavaScript to use them. All the details are wrapped inside the package, so you don’t need to worry about it.\nThere are many packages that provide htmlwidgets, including:\n\ndygraphs for interactive time series visualizations.\nDT for interactive tables.\nthreejs for interactive 3d plots.\nDiagrammeR for diagrams (like flow charts and simple node-link diagrams).\n\nTo learn more about htmlwidgets and see a complete list of packages that provide them visit https://www.htmlwidgets.org.\n\n29.5.2 Shiny\nhtmlwidgets provide client-side interactivity — all the interactivity happens in the browser, independently of R. On the one hand, that’s great because you can distribute the HTML file without any connection to R. However, that fundamentally limits what you can do to things that have been implemented in HTML and JavaScript. An alternative approach is to use shiny, a package that allows you to create interactivity using R code, not JavaScript.\nTo call Shiny code from a Quarto document, add server: shiny to the YAML header:\ntitle: \"Shiny Web App\"\nformat: html\nserver: shiny\nThen you can use the “input” functions to add interactive components to the document:\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\ntextInput(\"name\", \"What is your name?\")\nnumericInput(\"age\", \"How old are you?\", NA, min = 0, max = 150)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you also need a code chunk with chunk option context: server which contains the code that needs to run in a Shiny server.\nYou can then refer to the values with input$name and input$age, and the code that uses them will be automatically re-run whenever they change.\nWe can’t show you a live shiny app here because shiny interactions occur on the server-side. This means that you can write interactive apps without knowing JavaScript, but you need a server to run them on. This introduces a logistical issue: Shiny apps need a Shiny server to be run online. When you run Shiny apps on your own computer, Shiny automatically sets up a Shiny server for you, but you need a public-facing Shiny server if you want to publish this sort of interactivity online. That’s the fundamental trade-off of shiny: you can do anything in a shiny document that you can do in R, but it requires someone to be running R.\nFor learning more about Shiny, we recommend reading Mastering Shiny by Hadley Wickham, https://mastering-shiny.org.",

    "text": "29.6 Websites and books\nWith a bit of additional infrastructure, you can use Quarto to generate a complete website or book:\n\nPut your .qmd files in a single directory. index.qmd will become the home page.\n\nAdd a YAML file named _quarto.yml that provides the navigation for the site. In this file, set the project type to either book or website, e.g.:\nproject:\n  type: book\n\n\nFor example, the following _quarto.yml file creates a website from three source files: index.qmd (the home page), viridis-colors.qmd, and terrain-colors.qmd.\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n\nwebsite:\n  title: \"A website on color scales\"\n  navbar:\n    left:\n      - href: index.qmd\n        text: Home\n      - href: viridis-colors.qmd\n        text: Viridis colors\n      - href: terrain-colors.qmd\n        text: Terrain colors\n\nThe _quarto.yml file you need for a book is very similarly structured. The following example shows how you can create a book with four chapters that renders to three different outputs (html, pdf, and epub). Once again, the source files are .qmd files.\n\nproject:\n  type: book\n\nbook:\n  title: \"A book on color scales\"\n  author: \"Jane Coloriste\"\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - intro.qmd\n    - viridis-colors.qmd\n    - terrain-colors.qmd\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n  pdf: default\n  epub: default\n\nWe recommend that you use an RStudio project for your websites and books. Based on the _quarto.yml file, RStudio will recognize the type of project you’re working on, and add a Build tab to the IDE that you can use to render and preview your websites and books. Both websites and books can also be rendered using quarto::quarto_render().\nRead more at https://quarto.org/docs/websites about Quarto websites and https://quarto.org/docs/books about books.",

It provides a set of effective patterns (both low- and high-level) that you can apply to improve your presentations.\nIf you give academic talks, you might like the Leek group guide to giving talks.\nWe haven’t taken it ourselves, but we’ve heard good things about Matt McGarrity’s online course on public speaking: https://www.coursera.org/learn/public-speaking.\nIf you are creating many dashboards, make sure to read Stephen Few’s Information Dashboard Design: The Effective Visual Communication of Data. It will help you create dashboards that are truly useful, not just pretty to look at.\nEffectively communicating your ideas often benefits from some knowledge of graphic design. Robin Williams’ The Non-Designer’s Design Book is a great place to start.",

We want to show you the “whole game” of data science giving you just enough of all the major pieces so that you can tackle real, if simple, datasets. The later parts of the book will hit each of these topics in more depth, increasing the range of data science challenges that you can tackle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: In this section of the book, you’ll learn how to import, tidy, transform, and visualize data.\n\n\n\n\nFour chapters focus on the tools of data science:\n\nVisualization is a great place to start with R programming, because the payoff is so clear: you get to make elegant and informative plots that help you understand data. In 1  Data visualization you’ll dive into visualization, learning the basic structure of a ggplot2 plot, and powerful techniques for turning data into plots.\nVisualization alone is typically not enough, so in 3  Data transformation, you’ll learn the key verbs that allow you to select important variables, filter out key observations, create new variables, and compute summaries.\nIn 5  Data tidying, you’ll learn about tidy data, a consistent way of storing your data that makes transformation, visualization, and modelling easier. You’ll learn the underlying principles, and how to get your data into a tidy form.\nBefore you can transform and visualize your data, you need to first get your data into R. In 7  Data import you’ll learn the basics of getting .csv files into R.\n\nNestled among these chapters are four other chapters that focus on your R workflow. In 2  Workflow: basics, 4  Workflow: code style, and 6  Workflow: scripts and projects you’ll learn good workflow practices for writing and organizing your R code. These will set you up for success in the long run, as they’ll give you the tools to stay organized when you tackle real projects. Finally, 8  Workflow: getting help will teach you how to get help and keep learning.",

The absolute best place to learn more is the ggplot2 book: ggplot2: Elegant graphics for data analysis. It goes into much more depth about the underlying theory, and has many more examples of how to combine the individual pieces to solve practical problems. Another great resource is the ggplot2 extensions gallery https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/. This site lists many of the packages that extend ggplot2 with new geoms and scales.

These are the simplest types of vectors, but are extremely powerful. You’ll learn how to create them with numeric comparisons, how to combine them with Boolean algebra, how to use them in summaries, and how to use them for conditional transformations.\n13  Numbers dives into tools for vectors of numbers, the powerhouse of data science. You’ll learn more about counting and a bunch of important transformation and summary functions.\n14  Strings will give you the tools to work with strings: you’ll slice them, you’ll dice them, and you’ll stick them back together again. This chapter mostly focuses on the stringr package, but you’ll also learn some more tidyr functions devoted to extracting data from character strings.\n15  Regular expressions introduces you to regular expressions, a powerful tool for manipulating strings. This chapter will take you from thinking that a cat walked over your keyboard to reading and writing complex string patterns.\n16  Factors introduces factors: the data type that R uses to store categorical data. You use a factor when variable has a fixed set of possible values, or when you want to use a non-alphabetical ordering of a string.\n17  Dates and times will give you the key tools for working with dates and date-times. Unfortunately, the more you learn about date-times, the more complicated they seem to get, but with the help of the lubridate package, you’ll learn to how to overcome the most common challenges.\n18  Missing values discusses missing values in depth. We’ve discussed them a couple of times in isolation, but now it’s time to discuss them holistically, helping you come to grips with the difference between implicit and explicit missing values, and how and why you might convert between them.\n19  Joins finishes up this part of the book by giving you tools to join two (or more) data frames together. Learning about joins will force you to grapple with the idea of keys, and think about how you identify each row in a dataset.",

    "text": "In this part of the book, you’ll improve your programming skills. Programming is a cross-cutting skill needed for all data science work: you must use a computer to do data science; you cannot do it in your head, or with pencil and paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Programming is the water in which all the other components swim.\n\n\n\n\nProgramming produces code, and code is a tool of communication. Obviously code tells the computer what you want it to do. But it also communicates meaning to other humans. Thinking about code as a vehicle for communication is important because every project you do is fundamentally collaborative. Even if you’re not working with other people, you’ll definitely be working with future-you! Writing clear code is important so that others (like future-you) can understand why you tackled an analysis in the way you did. That means getting better at programming also involves getting better at communicating. Over time, you want your code to become not just easier to write, but easier for others to read.\nIn the following three chapters, you’ll learn skills to improve your programming skills:\n\nCopy-and-paste is a powerful tool, but you should avoid doing it more than twice. Repeating yourself in code is dangerous because it can easily lead to errors and inconsistencies. Instead, in 25  Functions, you’ll learn how to write functions which let you extract out repeated tidyverse code so that it can be easily reused.\nFunctions extract out repeated code, but you often need to repeat the same actions on different inputs. You need tools for iteration that let you do similar things again and again. These tools include for loops and functional programming, which you’ll learn about in 26  Iteration.\nAs you read more code written by others, you’ll see more code that doesn’t use the tidyverse. In 27  A field guide to base R, you’ll learn some of the most important base R functions that you’ll see in the wild.\n\nThe goal of these chapters is to teach you the minimum about programming that you need for data science. Once you have mastered the material here, we strongly recommend that you continue to invest in your programming skills. We’ve written two books that you might find helpful. Hands on Programming with R, by Garrett Grolemund, is an introduction to R as a programming language and is a great place to start if R is your first programming language. Advanced R by Hadley Wickham dives into the details of R the programming language; it’s great place to start if you have existing programming experience and great next step once you’ve internalized the ideas in these chapters.",
